As a result, there has been growing attention to\\nthe role of nature-based solutions (NbS) for addressing societal challenges, notably to mitigate\\nand adapt to climate change [3,4]', '. These interventions are defined as ‘actions to protect, con-\\nserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal\\nand marine ecosystems, which address social, economic and environmental challenges effec-\\ntively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services\\nand resilience and biodiversity benefits” [5]', '. However, the fundamental structural drivers of\\nbiodiversity loss and climate change are rarely made explicit when discussing NbS. This\\nincludes the narrow free-market frame through which policy decisions are often made [6] and\\nthe imperative for economic growth as measured through GDP [7]. Nature is presented as a\\nsolution to human problems [8] often without considering the social and political drivers of\\nenvironmental challenges [9], fueling criticism towards NbS (e.g., [10,11])', '. Yet, reversing bio-\\ndiversity loss is dependent on addressing these underlying drivers to generate the enabling\\nenvironment for NbS to be successful [12].\\nDominant NbS narratives (i.e., values-driven stories that are assumed to be factual about\\nproblems and their proposed solutions, in which concepts like NbS are embedded; [13] have\\nbeen called out for upholding neoliberal values and framings of nature at the expense of others\\n[14–16]', '. Neoliberalism, as an ideology, promotes the notion of unrestrained ‘free’ markets, pri-\\nvatization, deregulation, and reduction in government spending [17] to unlock a growth-\\nfocused vision of development [18]', '. Although NbS can be viewed in a plurality of ways, neolib-\\neralism is often reflected through the instrumental values and technocratic perspectives under-\\npinning dominant NbS frames [19] as well as the growing prioritization of private-led\\ninitiatives over public investment for public goods [20]', '. Proponents of this view often describe\\nnature purely as a commodifiable asset class, promote market-based mechanisms (notably car-\\nbon markets) as the main way to fund nature recovery and position the private sector as cen-\\ntral stewards (issues raised in [4,21,22]). Many view NbS as a mechanism to unlock finance\\nand bridge the funding gap between biodiversity and climate initiatives, currently estimated to\\nbe on the order of 878.9 to 891.3 billion USD [23,24]', '. Yet, challenges in securing finance\\nremains a key barrier to scaling place-based NbS (i.e., interventions designed in-tune with spe-\\ncific social, ecological, and political contexts) [25–27], which require the need for diverse pri-\\nvate and public finance flows as called for in targets 18 and 19, respectively, of the recently\\nadopted Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) [28]', '. In addition to bridg-\\ning the biodiversity funding gap, channeling private capital flows towards biodiversity conser-\\nvation and NbS may also drive certain capital flows away from activities that degrade and\\ndamage biodiversity and ecosystem services.\\nIndeed, there are promising opportunities for private finance to contribute to scaling-up\\nNbS and delivering climate resilient landscapes', '. For example, co-financing between public\\nand private actors has been identified as a key steppingstone to design and maintain urban\\nNbS [29,30]. Opportunities to invest in NbS, such as through credit-based schemes, also pro-\\nvide an avenue to meet corporate commitment for biodiversity and climate, while increasing,\\nin theory, the flows of finance to people and biodiversity', '. Avenues for channeling sizable pri-\\nvate finance flows are growing–for example, Climate Asset Management recently secured USD\\n$650 million for its natural capital strategies focusing on landscape regeneration [31]', '. How-\\never, these are currently limited to ‘mature’ revenue-generating NbS, such as in the context of\\nagricultural production (e.g., agroforestry) or forestry (e.g., managing diverse species forests to\\nboost the resilience of timber production), as well as nature-based carbon offsets [32]', '. These\\nrepresent a restricted subset of the broader portfolio of NbS needed to tackle climate change\\nPLOS CLIMATE\\nMoving beyond neoliberal visions of NbS to foster just transformative futures\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000169\\nApril 6, 2023\\n2 / 17', 'and other societal challenges at scale, and recent concerns over the validity of carbon offsets\\nfor avoided deforestation also undermine scaling voluntary carbon markets [33,34]', '. For some\\nmechanisms, such as green bonds, the scattered and small-scale nature of most NbS also con-\\nflicts with the large-scale nature of portfolios needed to attract private finance [24].\\nConsidering these limited avenues for private finance flows, calls have been made to sub-\\nstantially scale up financial instruments and market-based mechanisms (hereafter simplified\\nto market-based mechanisms) [23,32,35]', '. These currently represent a small proportion of\\nfinance for NbS [32], and include bond markets [36], biodiversity credits [37], wetland mitiga-\\ntion credits [38], the use of biodiversity and nutrient credits in the recently adopted biodiver-\\nsity net gain legislation in the UK [39], or mechanisms to monetize avoided costs (where\\nrevenues are generated through capturing a portion of cost savings to beneficiaries; [32]).\\nThere has been a particularly strong push by the private sector and multilateral bodies to\\nattract private capital flows for NbS (e.g., [23,40]), including through blended finance schemes\\nwhereby public grant funding is used to stimulate finance from private and institutional finan-\\nciers by mitigating investment risks [35]', '. Calls for a global scaling-up of natural capital mar-\\nkets as the main mechanism to address climate change and ecological breakdown have also\\nbeen made (e.g., [41]). Such mechanisms are closely intertwined with, and dependent upon,\\ninnovations like natural capital accounting to create tradable financial asset classes from biodi-\\nversity and ecosystem services.\\nAlthough mechanisms for trading natural capital assets (e.g', '. through carbon or biodiversity\\ncredits) present an attractive opportunity to bridge the biodiversity funding gap, there are pit-\\nfalls and risks with their establishment which can compromise NbS effectiveness and scaling if\\nnot addressed', '. A significant concern is also that the financialization of natural capital (i.e., the\\ncommodification and trading of natural capital assets in financial markets) conveniently fur-\\nthers the interests of those benefiting from capital accumulation, while reducing pressures on\\nbusiness and government to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises at their root, in turn\\nincreasing the risk of greenwashing', '. Notably, this can occur where the implementation of NbS\\nreduces pressures to decarbonize at the source, which delays the rapid decarbonization needed\\nto meet the Paris Agreement and tackle biodiversity loss, while increasing economic inequali-\\nties [4,22]', '. While natural capital accounting can provide a powerful tool to constrain econo-\\nmies within biophysical boundaries [42,43] and support environmental management [44], the\\nfinancialization of natural capital can also reinforce the values (market-based and instrumen-\\ntal), social relations, and human-environment relations that sit at the core of the biodiversity\\nand climate crises [45], while reinforcing existing power and wealth inequalities', '. Our concern\\nis that this inhibits transformational change, as characterized by “a fundamental, system-wide\\nreorganization across technological, economic and social factors, including paradigms, goals\\nand values”, which is essential to address both the climate and biodiversity crises [46,47].\\nHere, we draw on recent research, governance, and practice to explore risks and pitfalls in\\nefforts to scale market-based mechanisms for NbS, in relation to fostering transformation and\\ncatalyzing actions that deliver for people, climate, and biodiversity', '. Although diversifying finan-\\ncial flows by leveraging private finance through well-regulated natural capital markets is impor-\\ntant, and the effectiveness of such mechanisms should be explored, we believe there currently is\\na lack of attention to its risks', '. This includes risks associated with the de-prioritization of land-\\nscapes where these schemes are not cost-effective, how these schemes are governed, including\\nhow costs, benefits, and risks are distributed, and how people’s diverse knowledges, values and\\npriorities are (or are not) reflected in the design and implementation of these mechanisms.\\nCalls to channel resources and efforts to scale up market-based mechanisms should be embed-\\nded in an honest value proposition of their potential, appreciative of limits to scalability and\\nimpact', '. We reflect on these issues, proposing four key recommendations for proponents of\\nPLOS CLIMATE\\nMoving beyond neoliberal visions of NbS to foster just transformative futures\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000169\\nApril 6, 2023\\n3 / 17', '\\n\\nNbS, with a focus on actors financing NbS (public and private) or those supporting efforts to\\nscale-finance (including private sector coalitions and NGOs), to foster just and equitable trans-\\nformative pathways in support of the CBD 2050 vision of “living in harmony with nature”.\\nThe pitfalls of a narrow focus on market-based mechanisms to finance\\nnature-based solutions\\nWhile a plurality of mechanisms to channel finance for investments in nature is required,\\nincluding market-based mechanisms, we are concerned that complementary finance mecha-\\nnisms, such as fiscal policy measures or direct cash transfers [24,48], are often perceived as\\npolitically intractable and therefore largely sidelined', '.

Below, we highlight 5 additional pitfalls\\nof de-prioritizing public funding and chiefly relying on natural capital markets to scale up NbS.\\nA. Limits to scalability.\\nThe potential of financing NbS through natural capital markets\\n(i.e., where natural assets representing biodiversity or ecosystem services are traded) is con-\\nstrained for several reasons', '. First, the quantification and mapping of flows of ecosystem ser-\\nvices remains difficult and prone to error, even at the landscape scale [49,50]. Further,\\naccounting for the impact of climate change on these services remains challenging [51]', '. Further,\\naccounting for the impact of climate change on these services remains challenging [51]. Eco-\\nsystem service valuation, despite substantial progress, is in turn limited by a bias of available\\ndata towards certain geographies and types of ecosystem services–mainly, those that are instru-\\nmental, tangible, or easily measured with numerical metrics [6,52]', '. And, for biocredit schemes\\n(i.e., tradeable credits based on biodiversity to incentivize conservation and restoration), incor-\\nporating the multifaceted aspects of biodiversity meaningfully remains challenging [37].\\nSecond, as mentioned, the subset of NbS attractive to private investors is already primarily\\nrestricted to commercially mature sectors (notably forestry, agriculture, and water) and the\\ngrowing carbon credit market [32]', '. Many ecosystem services (notably supporting, regulating,\\nand cultural ones), and the natural and social capital on which they are based, are non-rival\\nand or non-excludable, meaning that private property regimes and markets alone are ineffec-\\ntive and inappropriate institutions to manage them sustainably [53,54]', '. Further, although nat-\\nural capital markets beyond carbon credits are emerging (e.g., biocredits), these are a long way\\nfrom maturation, although exceptions exist (e.g., the US wetland credit schemes) [38]. And,\\nwhile the ostensibly large untapped potential of the carbon market is often used to attract\\ninvestors (e.g., [55]), this mechanism alone is not enough to scale up NbS', '. A recent analysis\\nestimates that 80% of potential implementation opportunities for NbS in tropical forest regions\\nare currently not financially viable (in terms of return on investment) through a purely mar-\\nket-based approach (e.g., voluntary carbon offset mechanisms) when considering the costs of\\nimplementation, management, and monitoring [56]. These transaction costs conflict with\\ninstitutional investor appetite for near-term, competitive returns [20]', '. These transaction costs conflict with\\ninstitutional investor appetite for near-term, competitive returns [20]. Given that verifying\\nbiodiversity credits meaningfully is currently more onerous than for carbon [37], this suggests\\nfurther constrained potential for these schemes. Although lowering the transaction costs of\\nverifying transactions and credits through technology (e.g., such as through advances in\\neDNA) can make these schemes more cost-effective, significant barriers remain', '. More funda-\\nmentally, lack of market maturity can make it difficult to set adequate prices meeting the needs\\nof Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) and biodiversity conservation, in part\\nbecause of a potential mismatch with investor willingness to pay for credits [37]', '. Therefore,\\nalthough well-regulated natural capital markets can contribute finance for NbS, alternative\\nfunding mechanisms remain essential to scale NbS, as discussed below [23].\\nPLOS CLIMATE\\nMoving beyond neoliberal visions of NbS to foster just transformative futures\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000169\\nApril 6, 2023\\n4 / 17', 'B. Reinforcing the separation of people and nature. When nature is described purely in\\nterms of something that works for people [57,58] it tends to reinforce the human-nature\\ndichotomy (i.e., the separation of non-human nature and human-culture) [59]', '. Though plac-\\ning a monetary value on the many ways nature supports human economies enables the inclu-\\nsion of some values in national and corporate accounting and hence decision making, the risk\\nis that the potential of NbS to provide just and hence sustainable, long-term, benefits to people\\nand nature together will be undermined [19]', '. In the context of natural capital markets, the dis-\\nconnect between people and nature is reinforced, because such markets are built from and\\npromote a framework which extracts and categorizes elements of nature from its whole [60].\\nThis is evident where natural capital markets are used to stimulate financial flows from distant\\nactors for their capital gain', '. This matters because unchecked pressures to ensure monetary\\nreturns for distant investors can risk jeopardizing social-ecological resilience, as these may\\ninterfere with the dynamic, place-based interactions between people and nature which sustain\\nNbS [61,62]', '. For example, a narrow focus on monetizable aspects of natural capital such as car-\\nbon stocks can generate market-pressures to optimize landscapes for these, instead of the\\nholistic management necessary for delivering bundles of benefits and ultimately resilient NbS\\n[63,64]. The challenge resulting from the separation of external investors and place-based NbS\\nis recognized by private finance institutions, as it also makes transactions and ‘asset perfor-\\nmance’ difficult to manage’ [32]', '.

A limited view of barriers to scaling nature-based solutions.\\nWhile establishing natu-\\nral capital markets may appear attractive to channel finance from the private sector, this alone\\nwill not shift behavior of actors profiting from extracting industries', '. While monetary valuation\\nincorporates some economic dimensions of nature’s value into policy decision making, it does\\nnot address significant barriers to scaling NbS, such as path dependency [67,68] and siloed\\ndecision-making [27]. A narrow focus on economic rationality also sidelines the need for\\ntransformation in social relations and power dynamics [69], bolstering the power of those\\nbenefiting from extraction [70]', '. Such transformation requires careful management, regulation,\\nand a prioritization of rights-based approaches and devolved, local decision-making, as is\\nadvocated through the concept of ‘locally led adaptation’ [71]. Further, framing nature as a\\nprovider of commodifiable, monetizable services can also crowd out values and intrinsic social\\nmotivations driving stewardship (e.g., relational values), thereby hindering pro-environmental\\nbehavior change in certain contexts [21,72–74].\\nD', '. Challenges in governance and achieving equity for IPLCs. Natural capital markets\\nfor NbS present significant governance challenges. We recognize that interventions harnessing\\nmarket-based mechanisms for finance, when carefully designed in close partnership with local\\ncommunities (Guideline 3 for successful NbS; nbsguidelines.info), can help secure flows of\\nfinance towards them', '. For example, recent research suggests a forest carbon offset in Panama\\nprovided financial stability to poorer participants to diversify income sources, although\\nincome inequality, overall, remained unchanged [75].

For example, in the\\ncontext of urban NbS, co-funding by private actors has been found to lead to a bias in NbS\\ntowards more affluent areas, because NbS (such as city parks) will be more successful at realiz-\\ning revenue streams in these areas [25,29]', '. Even where schemes explicitly focus on ensuring\\nbenefits flow back to less affluent areas, it isn’t clear how effectively finance will reach the\\nPLOS CLIMATE\\nMoving beyond neoliberal visions of NbS to foster just transformative futures\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000169\\nApril 6, 2023\\n5 / 17', 'intended custodians of nature, or how issues of elite capture will be addressed.

Although IPLCs steward at least 17% of global forest carbon, there remains\\na significant lack of progress on the legal recognition of IPLC forest tenure rights [82]', '. It also\\nremains unclear the extent to which or how the design and implementation of NbS financed\\nby such markets will uphold the knowledge, values, needs and aspirations of IPLCs across a\\ndiversity of governance contexts given the significant barriers to upholding their rights (e.g.\\n[83]). In turn, this conflicts with efforts to design schemes which support and center the IPLCs\\nwhose territories contain the natural “assets” investors are attempting to monetize', '. Natural\\ncapital valuation through standardized metrics currently remains largely incongruent with the\\nincorporation of plural local knowledges and other worldviews (i.e., other, non-Western ways\\nof knowing and relating to nature, such as Buen Vivir or Swaraj; see [84,85]) so crucial to\\ndelivering effective NbS, including those of IPLCs [86,87]. The notions of ‘capital’ and ‘assets’\\ncan further conflict with, de-legitimize, and crowd-out worldviews of IPLCs from environ-\\nmental decision-making', '. In turn, IPLCs become subject to the agendas of external actors, as\\n‘partners’ or passive beneficiaries, rather than decision-makers and leaders for their own terri-\\ntories, reinforcing unequal power dynamics in global environmental governance [22]. Simi-\\nlarly, with biodiversity credits, current schemes fail to balance scientific understandings of\\nbiodiversity with socio-cultural values [37], which challenges aligning credit schemes with the\\nknowledges, needs, values, and aspirations of IPLCs', '. Emerging biocultural valuation methods\\nmay address this [88,89], but adds a layer of complexity to designing credits, and might pose\\nconstraints to their fungibility (i.e., ensuring they interchangeable and comparable)', '. While\\ncalls for knowledge inclusion in environmental decision-making have grown louder, discus-\\nsions around biodiversity and climate are still largely dominated by natural scientists, econo-\\nmists, as well as large international NGOs and multilateral organizations that often embody a\\nWestern epistemology upholding a technical and dualistic interpretation of nature [90] (e.g.,\\nthe portrayal of nature as a tool to address societal challenges), and the prioritization of global,\\nand scientific, knowledge over local and traditional knowledge', '. These imbalances in who is at\\nthe table and whose knowledges are deemed credible in global environmental decision-making\\nreinforce inequalities on the ground. While safeguards are advocated as key to mitigate these\\npotential harms to people and biodiversity, they may suffer from a lack of enforceability and\\naccountability and can exacerbate existing inequities [91,92]', '.

Exposure to the boom-and-bust cycles inherent\\nin global capitalism may also further exacerbate the vulnerability of countries and local com-\\nmunities in the Global South [20]', '.

Recognize nature-based solutions as place-based partnerships between people and\\nnature that harness diverse values.\\nWe argue that NbS should reflect regenerative, sustain-\\nable relationships with the natural world, such as those long recognized by many Indigenous\\ncultures [48,86,87,102,103]', '. In other words, NbS are not equivalent to natural capital and ensu-\\ning ecosystem services; they are place-based partnerships involving people working with\\nnature, as a part of nature, to harness co-benefits and address societal challenges [4,19]. To\\nmanage landscapes sustainably, including through Nature-based Solutions (NbS), it is impor-\\ntant to recognize land as a system of mutual relationships and responsibilities, a notion often\\nrooted in the cultural-spiritual context of many IPLCs [87]', '. It is crucial to ensure that any\\nmechanism to finance NbS supports this, which in turn requires addressing the potential dis-\\nconnect between distant financial actors and their priorities, and the place-based human\\nnature interactions underpinning NbS', '. This can be achieved, in part, by strengthening rela-\\ntions between investors and entities overseeing projects on the ground, as well as with social\\nand environmental NGOs, and supporting efforts to mainstream non-monetary metrics to\\nhelp identify ‘successful’ investments [32].\\nAddressing this potential disconnect is key to ensure NbS deliver plural benefits, particularly\\nfor the people inhabiting the landscapes where NbS are implemented', '.

Accommo-\\ndating a greater diversity of values in decision-making, therefore, is crucial to deliver healthy,\\nresilient landscapes [84,109]', '. Hence, when framing NbS, there is a need to embrace diverse per-\\nspectives and values and retain a core focus on the co-dependency of people and nature, rather\\nthan the notion of nature working for people (i.e., the ecosystem-service lens) [19].\\nShifting away from a narrow “nature for people” perspective allows recognizing the many\\nbenefits fostered by NbS through human-nature relations', '. Indeed, this sits at the core of the\\nargument by IPBES that narrowly valuing nature through the lens of the market has played a\\nmajor role in driving biodiversity loss [6].

Recognize the role of IPLCs as leaders of nature-based solutions.\\nWelcoming plural\\nvalues, perspectives, and knowledges, in turn requires reframing how IPLCs are characterized\\nin NbS discourses', '. Despite the emphasis on the importance of IPLCs as effective stewards of\\nlands and biodiversity, and increasing emphasis on the need for indigenous-led solutions\\n[113,114], IPLCs are often portrayed as ‘partners’ for or passive ‘beneficiaries’ of environmental\\npolicy decisions within global policy discourses, including for NbS [22].

Emphasizing this point, WEF (2023) recommends IPLCs be\\nco-investment leaders in NbS [113]', '. Emphasizing this point, WEF (2023) recommends IPLCs be\\nco-investment leaders in NbS [113]. This implies that the ‘solution’ must be shaped first and\\nforemost by IPLCs around their needs and perspectives, rather than those of external actors (as\\nspecified in Criterion 1 of the IUCN standard; [115])', '. It is then crucial to engage IPLCs from\\nthe very beginning through inclusive processes, and ensure that their knowledges, values, needs,\\nand aspirations are upheld [115,116], while simultaneously supporting Indigenous entre-\\npreneurship, as exemplified by the Indigenous-led funds, such as the Amazon Fund to increase\\ndirect access to climate finance [117], or the Pawanka Fund (https://pawankafund.org)', '. The\\nway existing natural capital markets currently reduce nature to a commodity that distant finan-\\ncial actors can purchase the rights to reflects the scenarios many Indigenous Peoples groups\\n[101] as well as some policy makers [118], warn about and actively push against within NbS dis-\\ncourses [22]', '. Mechanisms for financing and implementing NbS must pay attention to historical\\nand present impacts of colonial legacies and Indigenous-settler government relationships [87]\\nwhile protecting Indigenous land and resource rights [86]. It is also important to identify when\\nand where market mechanisms such as biocredits may not be appropriate for IPLCs [37], as\\nIndigenous peoples and their aspirations are not globally homogenous [119]', '. The desire to scale\\nthese schemes could otherwise infringe on locally led approaches. To promote effective Nature-\\nbased Solutions (NbS) that benefit both nature and people, it is important to go beyond superfi-\\ncial representation of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) in global NbS dis-\\ncourses', '. This requires creating fair mechanisms that address power imbalances between rich\\nand poor countries as well as powerful and marginalized actors.\\nIt is also crucial to pay attention to potential power shifts resulting from increasing flows of\\nfinance which may jeopardize transparency, equity and further marginalize local communities.\\nDeveloping robust governance mechanisms that ensure NbS are responsive to local communi-\\nties’ priorities and preferences, are attentive to diverse and marginalized actors within broader\\ncommunities, and that have appropriate accountability mechanisms in place, is a critical chal-\\nlenge', '. Increasing focus should be placed on collaborative partnerships between investors, local\\nPLOS CLIMATE\\nMoving beyond neoliberal visions of NbS to foster just transformative futures\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000169\\nApril 6, 2023\\n8 / 17', 'communities, governments, or non-government organizations which are founded on trust-\\nbased, risk sharing arrangements that balance financial returns with positive impact [32,51].\\nC. Recognize alternative modes of finance.\\nInnovative financing mechanisms to increase\\nthe flow of private finance to NbS, such as biodiversity focused green bond mechanisms, will\\nplay an important role in scaling NbS', '. However, bridging the nature recovery funding gap\\nrequires complementary modes of generating finance, beyond market-based mechanisms\\n[23,120]. Here we highlight four critical examples:\\ni. Repurpose harmful government subsidies', '. Here we highlight four critical examples:\\ni. Repurpose harmful government subsidies. It is crucial for governments to repurpose harm-\\nful government subsidies towards actions that are environmentally beneficial, such as posi-\\ntive economic incentives rewarding sustainable land management, as called for in the\\nrecently adopted Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) [121]; see Tar-\\nget 18)', '. For example, the Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) in England is\\ndesigned to financially reward sustainable farmland management for the generation of pub-\\nlic goods [122]. Currently, subsidies are instead shoring up exploitative, extractive industries\\n(notably in the fishing, agricultural, and fossil fuel sectors), with recent research showing\\nthese aggregate to a total of $1.8 trillion USD per year [123]', '. Alone, repurposing harmful\\nagricultural subsidies could double funding annually for nature, globally [24].\\nii. Tax environmentally harmful activities. Significant funding for NbS can be leveraged\\nthrough taxation of environmentally harmful activities–for example, scaling a tropical car-\\nbon tax, as recently implemented by Costa Rica and Columbia, could yield an additional\\nUSD 13 billion each year towards NbS [24]', '. Simultaneously, environmentally beneficial\\nactivities, such as the implementation of green roofs and sustainable drainages systems\\n(SuDS) in urban areas, should be incentivized through supportive tax regimes [26]. Both\\nrepurposing environmentally harmful subsidies and implementing tax regimes to incentiv-\\nize environmentally beneficial activities would send a clear and powerful signal to markets\\nthat nature is valuable, thereby further catalyzing private finance [24].\\niii', '. Direct funding of nature. Governments can also directly fund investments in nature,\\nincluding as part of COVID-19 recovery measures [120], while also making bailouts for\\ncorporate finance or polluting industries conditional to achieving social and environmen-\\ntal objectives [124]', '. Beyond supporting crucial ecosystem services, such direct investments\\nin nature have strong economic multiplier effects for jobs and economic output [125–127],\\noften greater than those associated with investments in traditional sectors (e.g.\\nmanufacturing, oil, and gas) [128,129]. Increased fiscal spending for nature to deliver pub-\\nlic goods would also align with recent shifts in macroeconomic policy aimed at supporting\\nthe COVID-19 recovery or tackling inflation [20]', '. Development banks are also playing a\\ncrucial role in mainstreaming NbS. For example, the European Investment Bank, through\\nthe natural capital financing facility, is providing reduced interest loans to the city of Athens\\nto roll out blue-green infrastructure as a large-scale climate solution, across 400 sites within\\nthe city boundaries [26]', '. Finance can further be scaled-up through common asset trusts,\\nwhereby both private and public entities fund the protection of the commons, with their\\ncontribution weighed by the marketable and public benefits they derive, respectively [53].\\niv. Decolonial finance mechanisms. Unconditional cash transfers or debt relief schemes\\ncould substantially relieve the burden of debt on poor countries’ national budgets, towards\\nallocating resources for addressing environmental and social challenges [130]', '. A recent\\nanalysis shows that conservation basic income could generate between $466 billion to $6.73\\ntrillion USD annually [131] which would help foster locally-led NbS in the Global South.\\nPLOS CLIMATE\\nMoving beyond neoliberal visions of NbS to foster just transformative futures\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000169\\nApril 6, 2023\\n9 / 17', 'D. Shift away from the imperative for economic growth.\\nAlthough the potential of NbS\\nfor economic growth should be harnessed where growth is desirable (e.g., in supporting the\\ngrowth of the nature restoration sector or supporting more sustainable modes of development\\nacross lower income countries), NbS should not be used as a tool to promote an agenda for\\nperpetual growth', '. The imperative for economic growth is a key driver for scaling natural capi-\\ntal markets and is a formidable barrier to transformational change, in that it is a core aspect of\\nthe economic paradigm which drives unsustainable development [18,132]. Failure to recognize\\nthis directly counters the notion of transformation as characterized by a system-wide reorgani-\\nzation across technological, economic, and social factors', '. In the near term, this represents sig-\\nnificant challenges as it requires breaking economic dependency on growth while avoiding\\ngrowing inequality, job losses, and tackling inflationary pressures. Yet, overcoming these chal-\\nlenges is necessary because perpetual economic growth in a finite world jeopardizes progress\\ntowards addressing the climate and biodiversity crises [7,54,132]', '. This is because economic\\ngrowth is coupled (in absolute terms) to energy demand and material footprint (i.e., increasing\\ndemand for land and exploitation of natural resources) [133,134]. This renders reductions in\\naggregate resource use and the rapid CO2 emissions reductions necessary to stay within 2.0C,\\nunfeasible [132,135]', '. This renders reductions in\\naggregate resource use and the rapid CO2 emissions reductions necessary to stay within 2.0C,\\nunfeasible [132,135]. Therefore, instead of seeking to promote “nature-based” economic\\ngrowth, we argue that it is crucial to decenter GDP growth as a core economic and political tar-\\nget, refocusing instead on human and ecological well-being [136]', '. This includes embracing\\nalternative metrics accounting undervalued public goods and services, including through eco-\\nsystems and biodiversity, and the socioeconomic distribution of these [137]. Delivering a\\nfuture where nature and people thrive requires focusing on developing and maintaining circu-\\nlar economies, in harmony with nature, rather than economies narrowly and dangerously\\nfocused on GDP-based economic growth as an end-goal', '. We fear that limiting finance for NbS\\nreliant on economic growth will jeopardize efforts to foster genuine transformational change.\\nConclusions\\nAs nature-based solutions gain popularity, there is need for critical reflection on how they are\\nfinanced, for this holds important implications for how NbS impact natural ecosystems and\\nthe people dependent upon them', '. Well-regulated financial markets can play an important role\\nin leveraging finance for place-based NbS that support good ecological health and human well-\\nbeing, but there is evidence that potential pitfalls are being ignored in the rush to scale up\\nfunding', '. To stay true to the value propositions of NbS, it is crucial to ensure that financial\\ninstruments and natural capital markets demonstrably address both justice and biodiversity\\nprotection, as one cannot be realized at scale without the other [138]. This is also key to ensure\\nthese schemes do not enable the exploitation and extraction of resources and profits from mar-\\nginalized communities', '. This is also key to ensure\\nthese schemes do not enable the exploitation and extraction of resources and profits from mar-\\nginalized communities. Calls for scaling-up natural capital markets should also be balanced\\nwith alternative modes of finance such as fiscal policy measures, debt relief schemes, or decolo-\\nnial climate reparations. The potential of scaling NbS through natural capital markets is other-\\nwise limited to landscapes where these schemes are cost-effective for investors', '. Actions that\\nstrengthen governance structures to support IPLC-led NbS in countries where NbS are imple-\\nmented are also essential.\\nFostering a transformative shift away from neoliberal, growth-based economic paradigms,\\ntowards valuing our relation and interdependency with the natural world [139] also requires\\nmarkets and policies that are informed by more holistic valuation methods beyond financial,\\nincorporating plural benefits and held values (e.g., through multi-criteria analysis, [140]; or\\nrisk-opportunity analysis beyond cost-benefit analyses, [141]), and that are grounded in\\nPLOS CLIMATE\\nMoving beyond neoliberal visions of NbS to foster just transformative futures\\nPLOS Climate | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000169\\nApril 6, 2023\\n10 / 17', 'sustainability and well-being, rather than narrowly focused on efficiency, short-term profits,\\nand economic growth [6]. In turn, this will help direct financial flows to the people and land-\\nscapes that need it.\\nFinally, we stress the importance of recognizing how the financialization of natural capital\\nis underpinned by the worldviews and power dynamics responsible for climate change and\\nbiodiversity loss', '. Solutions embedded in relational values that reflect the interdependency of\\necosystem health and human wellbeing are needed. Achieving the CBD 2050 vision of ‘living\\nin harmony with nature’ requires attending to the issues of power, politics, and justice which\\nsit at the core of the unsustainable status quo and shape flows of money and capital', '. It is essen-\\ntial for those advocating for NbS to avoid narratives that replicate or reinforce existing power\\nasymmetries in environmental governance [22]', '. As history shows us (e.g., the American civil\\nrights movement, feminist and environmental movements, or Indigenous-led movements;\\n[142]), tackling power imbalances requires welcoming peaceful social resistance, collective\\naction, and harnessing the power of grassroots movements, as called for by the UN Secretary-\\nGeneral Anto´nio Guterres [143].

            "Soil is a key component of Earth's critical zone. It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning base\n",

            "As a result of climate change, land degradation and losses in biodiversity, soil has become one of the world's most vulnerable resources (FAO and ITPS, 2015a and 2015b). Addressing soil and land degradation is a core challenge for sustainable development. Soil and land degradation has adverse impacts on ecosystem services that help safeguard food security, maintain water quality and availability, protect human health and establish the basis for a range of socio-economic activities. Sustainable soil and land management practices that are adapted to the local biophysical and socio-economic conditions can provide options for enhancing the interactions among soil, water, livestock and plants, which can prevent, slow or stop soil degradation and mitigate the impacts of climate change (Lal, 2013).\n",
            "Sustainable land management refers to:\n",
            "the use of land resources, including soil, water, animals and plants, for the production of goods to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the long-term productive potential of these resources and the maintenance of their environmental functions (United Nations Earth Summit, 1992).\n",
            "Sustainable land management includes measures that are suited to the specific biophysical and socio-economic conditions in a given area for the protection; promote the conservation and sustainable use of soil, water and and genetic diversity; and restore or rehabilitate degraded natural resources and revitalize the ecosystem functions.\n",
            "Soil management is considered sustainable if:\n",
            "the supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services provided by soil are maintained or enhanced without significantly impairing either the soil functions that enable those services or biodiversity. The balance between the supporting and provisioning services for plant production and the regulating services of the soil provides for water quality and availability and for atmospheric greenhouse gas composition is a particular concern (FAO, 2015a, p.4).\n",
            "Further definitions of relevant concepts are provided in Box B7.1.\n",

Soil provides nutrients and water that are taken up through plant roots and contribute to the hydrological cycle and atmospheric gases. The diversity of life and abundance of biological activity that exist within the soil are greater than those in any other terrestrial ecosystem.\n",
            "Soil health\n",
            "is a precondition that enables the soil to provide the basic services for supporting plant growth and contributing to the regulation of nutrient, water, carbon and gaseous cycles. Soil health, and hence soil's productivity, are inextricably linked to its physical, chemical and biological properties. Of particular importance are its mineral composition, organic matter content, soil biodiversity and associated biological activity.\n",

            "The interaction between the different components of land resources determines the productivity and sustainability of any land-use system (Ziadat and Bayu, 2015). Land productivity depends directly on soil productivity and health. Healthy soils provide plants with the support and nutrients they need to grow and provide the foundation for agricultural production systems. A favourable climate and suitable management are needed to sustain production and help withstand the impacts of climate change. An imbalance in one or more of the components of land resources and their interactions will reduce the production capacity of the agricultural ecosystem and increase its vulnerability to climate change (Figure B7.1).\n",

It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning base\",

Smart Agriculture Sourcebook\\xa0|\\xa0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\\nClimate Smart Agriculture Sourcebook\\nSustainable soil/land management for Climate-Smart Agriculture\\nProduction and Resources\\nSustainable soil and land management and climate change\\nAs a result of climate change, land degradation and losses in biodiversity, soil has become one of the world's most vulnerable resources (FAO and ITPS, 2015a and 2015b). Addressing soil and land degradation is a core challenge for sustainable development. Soil and land degradation has adverse impacts on ecosystem services that help safeguard food security, maintain water quality and availability, protect human health and establish the basis for a range of socio-economic activities. Sustainable soil and land management practices that are adapted to the local biophysical and socio-economic conditions can provide options for enhancing the interactions among soil, water, livestock and plants, which can prevent, slow or stop soil degradation and mitigate the impacts of climate change (Lal, 2013).\\nSustainable land management refers to:\\nthe use of land resources, including soil, water, animals and plants, for the production of goods to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the long-term productive potential of these resources and the maintenance of their environmental functions (United Nations Earth Summit, 1992).\\nSustainable land management includes measures that are suited to the specific biophysical and socio-economic conditions in a given area for the protection; promote the conservation and sustainable use of soil, water and and genetic diversity; and restore or rehabilitate degraded natural resources and revitalize the ecosystem functions.\\nSoil management is considered sustainable if:\\nthe supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services provided by soil are maintained or enhanced without significantly impairing either the soil functions that enable those services or biodiversity. The balance between the supporting and provisioning services for plant production and the regulating services of the soil provides for water quality and availability and for atmospheric greenhouse gas composition is a particular concern (FAO, 2015a, p.4).\\nFurther definitions of relevant concepts are provided in Box B7.1.\\nChapter B7-1.1 looks at the challenges that climate change presents for the sustainable management of soil and land resources.\\nChapter B7-1.2\\nconsiders the opportunities that sustainable soil and land management offers for fostering climate change adaptation and mitigation.\\nBox B7.1\\xa0 Key concepts in sustainable soil and land management\\nSoil\\ni\\nis the foundation on which plants establish themselves and grow, and the basis for crop, forest and livestock production. Soil provides nutrients and water that are taken up through plant roots and contribute to the hydrological cycle and atmospheric gases. The diversity of life and abundance of biological activity that exist within the soil are greater than those in any other terrestrial ecosystem.\\nSoil health\\nis a precondition that enables the soil to provide the basic services for supporting plant growth and contributing to the regulation of nutrient, water, carbon and gaseous cycles. Soil health, and hence soil's productivity, are inextricably linked to its physical, chemical and biological properties. Of particular importance are its mineral composition, organic matter content, soil biodiversity and associated biological activity.\\nLand\\nas defined by the United Nations:\\nis a delineable area of the earth’s terrestrial surface, encompassing all attributes of the biosphere immediately above or below this surface including those of the near-surface climate, the soil and terrain forms, the surface hydrology (including shallow lakes, rivers, marshes, and swamps), the near-surface sedimentary layers and associated groundwater reserve, the plant and animal populations, the human settlement pattern and physical results of past and present human activity, such as terracing, water storage or drainage structures, infrastructure, buildings (UN, 1994).\\nThe interaction between the different components of land resources determines the productivity and sustainability of any land-use system (Ziadat and Bayu, 2015). Land productivity depends directly on soil productivity and health. Healthy soils provide plants with the support and nutrients they need to grow and provide the foundation for agricultural production systems. A favourable climate and suitable management are needed to sustain production and help withstand the impacts of climate change. An imbalance in one or more of the components of land resources and their interactions will reduce the production capacity of the agricultural ecosystem and increase its vulnerability to climate change (Figure B7.1).\\nSustainable soil and land management practices provide options to man\"}\n"

Avenues for channeling sizable pri-\\nvate finance flows are growing–for example, Climate Asset Management recently secured USD\\n$650 million for its natural capital strategies focusing on landscape regeneration [31]', '. Below, we highlight 5 additional pitfalls\\nof de-prioritizing public funding and chiefly relying on natural capital markets to scale up NbS.\\nA. Limits to scalability.\\nThe potential of financing NbS through natural capital markets\\n(i.e., where natural assets representing biodiversity or ecosystem services are traded) is con-\\nstrained for several reasons', '. This matters because unchecked pressures to ensure monetary\\nreturns for distant investors can risk jeopardizing social-ecological resilience, as these may\\ninterfere with the dynamic, place-based interactions between people and nature which sustain\\nNbS [61,62]', '. Challenges in governance and achieving equity for IPLCs. Natural capital markets\\nfor NbS present significant governance challenges. We recognize that interventions harnessing\\nmarket-based mechanisms for finance, when carefully designed in close partnership with local\\ncommunities (Guideline 3 for successful NbS; nbsguidelines.info), can help secure flows of\\nfinance towards them', '. This is a significant concern because IPLCs have been historically disenfranchised in\\nmarket-based conservation schemes due to power imbalances or lack of transparency in\\nfinance flows [37]. Although IPLCs steward at least 17% of global forest carbon, there remains\\na significant lack of progress on the legal recognition of IPLC forest tenure rights [82]', '. It also\\nremains unclear the extent to which or how the design and implementation of NbS financed\\nby such markets will uphold the knowledge, values, needs and aspirations of IPLCs across a\\ndiversity of governance contexts given the significant barriers to upholding their rights (e.g.\\n[83]). In turn, this conflicts with efforts to design schemes which support and center the IPLCs\\nwhose territories contain the natural “assets” investors are attempting to monetize', '. In turn, IPLCs become subject to the agendas of external actors, as\\n‘partners’ or passive beneficiaries, rather than decision-makers and leaders for their own terri-\\ntories, reinforcing unequal power dynamics in global environmental governance [22]. Simi-\\nlarly, with biodiversity credits, current schemes fail to balance scientific understandings of\\nbiodiversity with socio-cultural values [37], which challenges aligning credit schemes with the\\nknowledges, needs, values, and aspirations of IPLCs', '. Any mechanism which does not explicitly\\naddress and work to rectify this, will further marginalize the voices and needs of IPLCs on the\\nground, and amplify existing injustice and inequalities rooted in the historic and present\\nexclusion and suppression of IPLCs within environmental decision-making and initiatives\\n[100], in turn compromising effective NbS [4]', '. In other words, NbS are not equivalent to natural capital and ensu-\\ning ecosystem services; they are place-based partnerships involving people working with\\nnature, as a part of nature, to harness co-benefits and address societal challenges [4,19]. To\\nmanage landscapes sustainably, including through Nature-based Solutions (NbS), it is impor-\\ntant to recognize land as a system of mutual relationships and responsibilities, a notion often\\nrooted in the cultural-spiritual context of many IPLCs [87]', '. (2022) portray IPLCs as mere subjects ‘to be employed’ or ‘partners’ to deliver their vision\\nof a nature-based economy [41]. In turn, this reinforces power asymmetries between IPLCs and\\nexternal actors. Instead, for effective NbS finance and implementation, it is crucial to recognize\\nthe role of IPLCs as active leaders. Emphasizing this point, WEF (2023) recommends IPLCs be\\nco-investment leaders in NbS [113]', '. The\\nway existing natural capital markets currently reduce nature to a commodity that distant finan-\\ncial actors can purchase the rights to reflects the scenarios many Indigenous Peoples groups\\n[101] as well as some policy makers [118], warn about and actively push against within NbS dis-\\ncourses [22]', '. However, bridging the nature recovery funding gap\\nrequires complementary modes of generating finance, beyond market-based mechanisms\\n[23,120]. Here we highlight four critical examples:\\ni. Repurpose harmful government subsidies', '. This includes embracing\\nalternative metrics accounting undervalued public goods and services, including through eco-\\nsystems and biodiversity, and the socioeconomic distribution of these [137]. Delivering a\\nfuture where nature and people thrive requires focusing on developing and maintaining circu-\\nlar economies, in harmony with nature, rather than economies narrowly and dangerously\\nfocused on GDP-based economic growth as an end-goal', '. We fear that limiting finance for NbS\\nreliant on economic growth will jeopardize efforts to foster genuine transformational change.\\nConclusions\\nAs nature-based solutions gain popularity, there is need for critical reflection on how they are\\nfinanced, for this holds important implications for how NbS impact natural ecosystems and\\nthe people dependent upon them', '. Solutions embedded in relational values that reflect the interdependency of\\necosystem health and human wellbeing are needed. Achieving the CBD 2050 vision of ‘living\\nin harmony with nature’ requires attending to the issues of power, politics, and justice which\\nsit at the core of the unsustainable status quo and shape flows of money and capital', '.

Avenues for channeling sizable pri-\\nvate finance flows are growing–for example, Climate Asset Management recently secured USD\\n$650 million for its natural capital strategies focusing on landscape regeneration [31]', '. Below, we highlight 5 additional pitfalls\\nof de-prioritizing public funding and chiefly relying on natural capital markets to scale up NbS.\\nA. Limits to scalability.\\nThe potential of financing NbS through natural capital markets\\n(i.e., where natural assets representing biodiversity or ecosystem services are traded) is con-\\nstrained for several reasons', '. This matters because unchecked pressures to ensure monetary\\nreturns for distant investors can risk jeopardizing social-ecological resilience, as these may\\ninterfere with the dynamic, place-based interactions between people and nature which sustain\\nNbS [61,62]', '. Challenges in governance and achieving equity for IPLCs. Natural capital markets\\nfor NbS present significant governance challenges. We recognize that interventions harnessing\\nmarket-based mechanisms for finance, when carefully designed in close partnership with local\\ncommunities (Guideline 3 for successful NbS; nbsguidelines.info), can help secure flows of\\nfinance towards them', '. This is a significant concern because IPLCs have been historically disenfranchised in\\nmarket-based conservation schemes due to power imbalances or lack of transparency in\\nfinance flows [37]. Although IPLCs steward at least 17% of global forest carbon, there remains\\na significant lack of progress on the legal recognition of IPLC forest tenure rights [82]', '. It also\\nremains unclear the extent to which or how the design and implementation of NbS financed\\nby such markets will uphold the knowledge, values, needs and aspirations of IPLCs across a\\ndiversity of governance contexts given the significant barriers to upholding their rights (e.g.\\n[83]). In turn, this conflicts with efforts to design schemes which support and center the IPLCs\\nwhose territories contain the natural “assets” investors are attempting to monetize', '. In turn, IPLCs become subject to the agendas of external actors, as\\n‘partners’ or passive beneficiaries, rather than decision-makers and leaders for their own terri-\\ntories, reinforcing unequal power dynamics in global environmental governance [22]. Simi-\\nlarly, with biodiversity credits, current schemes fail to balance scientific understandings of\\nbiodiversity with socio-cultural values [37], which challenges aligning credit schemes with the\\nknowledges, needs, values, and aspirations of IPLCs', '. Any mechanism which does not explicitly\\naddress and work to rectify this, will further marginalize the voices and needs of IPLCs on the\\nground, and amplify existing injustice and inequalities rooted in the historic and present\\nexclusion and suppression of IPLCs within environmental decision-making and initiatives\\n[100], in turn compromising effective NbS [4]', '. In other words, NbS are not equivalent to natural capital and ensu-\\ning ecosystem services; they are place-based partnerships involving people working with\\nnature, as a part of nature, to harness co-benefits and address societal challenges [4,19]. To\\nmanage landscapes sustainably, including through Nature-based Solutions (NbS), it is impor-\\ntant to recognize land as a system of mutual relationships and responsibilities, a notion often\\nrooted in the cultural-spiritual context of many IPLCs [87]', '. (2022) portray IPLCs as mere subjects ‘to be employed’ or ‘partners’ to deliver their vision\\nof a nature-based economy [41]. In turn, this reinforces power asymmetries between IPLCs and\\nexternal actors. Instead, for effective NbS finance and implementation, it is crucial to recognize\\nthe role of IPLCs as active leaders. Emphasizing this point, WEF (2023) recommends IPLCs be\\nco-investment leaders in NbS [113]', '. The\\nway existing natural capital markets currently reduce nature to a commodity that distant finan-\\ncial actors can purchase the rights to reflects the scenarios many Indigenous Peoples groups\\n[101] as well as some policy makers [118], warn about and actively push against within NbS dis-\\ncourses [22]', '. However, bridging the nature recovery funding gap\\nrequires complementary modes of generating finance, beyond market-based mechanisms\\n[23,120]. Here we highlight four critical examples:\\ni. Repurpose harmful government subsidies', '. This includes embracing\\nalternative metrics accounting undervalued public goods and services, including through eco-\\nsystems and biodiversity, and the socioeconomic distribution of these [137]. Delivering a\\nfuture where nature and people thrive requires focusing on developing and maintaining circu-\\nlar economies, in harmony with nature, rather than economies narrowly and dangerously\\nfocused on GDP-based economic growth as an end-goal', '. We fear that limiting finance for NbS\\nreliant on economic growth will jeopardize efforts to foster genuine transformational change.\\nConclusions\\nAs nature-based solutions gain popularity, there is need for critical reflection on how they are\\nfinanced, for this holds important implications for how NbS impact natural ecosystems and\\nthe people dependent upon them', '. Solutions embedded in relational values that reflect the interdependency of\\necosystem health and human wellbeing are needed. Achieving the CBD 2050 vision of ‘living\\nin harmony with nature’ requires attending to the issues of power, politics, and justice which\\nsit at the core of the unsustainable status quo and shape flows of money and capital', '.

Although diversifying finan-\\ncial flows by leveraging private finance through well-regulated natural capital markets is impor-\\ntant, and the effectiveness of such mechanisms should be explored, we believe there currently is\\na lack of attention to its risks', '. This is an issue because developing the\\nscientific, technological, and governance know-how for scaling natural capital markets on a\\nglobal scale will not be quick, even if it were feasible or desirable, though addressing the cli-\\nmate and biodiversity crises is of the utmost urgency.

And,\\nwhile the ostensibly large untapped potential of the carbon market is often used to attract\\ninvestors (e.g., [55]), this mechanism alone is not enough to scale up NbS', '. In the context of natural capital markets, the dis-\\nconnect between people and nature is reinforced, because such markets are built from and\\npromote a framework which extracts and categorizes elements of nature from its whole [60].\\nThis is evident where natural capital markets are used to stimulate financial flows from distant\\nactors for their capital gain', '. It is crucial to consider several questions–Who defines and\\ngoverns natural capital markets? Who ensures private finance flows to the right places, ecosys-\\ntems, and people? How are the “right” places and people defined', '. To stay true to the value propositions of NbS, it is crucial to ensure that financial\\ninstruments and natural capital markets demonstrably address both justice and biodiversity\\nprotection, as one cannot be realized at scale without the other [138]. This is also key to ensure\\nthese schemes do not enable the exploitation and extraction of resources and profits from mar-\\nginalized communities', '. This is also key to ensure\\nthese schemes do not enable the exploitation and extraction of resources and profits from mar-\\nginalized communities.

A. WeldenID2, Marina S', '. Avenues for channeling sizable pri-\\nvate finance flows are growing–for example, Climate Asset Management recently secured USD\\n$650 million for its natural capital strategies focusing on landscape regeneration [31]', '. Challenges in governance and achieving equity for IPLCs. Natural capital markets\\nfor NbS present significant governance challenges. We recognize that interventions harnessing\\nmarket-based mechanisms for finance, when carefully designed in close partnership with local\\ncommunities (Guideline 3 for successful NbS; nbsguidelines.info), can help secure flows of\\nfinance towards them', '. This is a significant concern because IPLCs have been historically disenfranchised in\\nmarket-based conservation schemes due to power imbalances or lack of transparency in\\nfinance flows [37]. Although IPLCs steward at least 17% of global forest carbon, there remains\\na significant lack of progress on the legal recognition of IPLC forest tenure rights [82]', '. In turn, IPLCs become subject to the agendas of external actors, as\\n‘partners’ or passive beneficiaries, rather than decision-makers and leaders for their own terri-\\ntories, reinforcing unequal power dynamics in global environmental governance [22]. Simi-\\nlarly, with biodiversity credits, current schemes fail to balance scientific understandings of\\nbiodiversity with socio-cultural values [37], which challenges aligning credit schemes with the\\nknowledges, needs, values, and aspirations of IPLCs', '. The\\nway existing natural capital markets currently reduce nature to a commodity that distant finan-\\ncial actors can purchase the rights to reflects the scenarios many Indigenous Peoples groups\\n[101] as well as some policy makers [118], warn about and actively push against within NbS dis-\\ncourses [22]', '. This includes embracing\\nalternative metrics accounting undervalued public goods and services, including through eco-\\nsystems and biodiversity, and the socioeconomic distribution of these [137]. Delivering a\\nfuture where nature and people thrive requires focusing on developing and maintaining circu-\\nlar economies, in harmony with nature, rather than economies narrowly and dangerously\\nfocused on GDP-based economic growth as an end-goal', '.
