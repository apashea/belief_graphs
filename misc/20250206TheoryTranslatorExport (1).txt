&emsp;<i>To illustrate the simplicity of Active Inference—and what we are trying to explain—place your fingertips gently on your leg. Keep them there motionless for a second or two. Now, does your leg feel rough or smooth? If you had to move your fingers to evince a feeling of roughness or smoothness, you have discovered a fundament of Active Inference. To feel is to palpate. To see is to look. To hear is to listen. This palpation does not necessarily have to be overt—we can act covertly by directing our attention to this or that. In short, we are not simply trying to make sense of our sensations; we have to actively create our sensorium.

67;active inference;"The normative aspect of Active Inference is that living organisms must face their fundamental existential challenges. The fundamental challenge is existence, in other words, survival and adaptation. Organisms face this by developing adaptive strategies, namely, minimizing their free energy. Active inference researchers similarly face the challenge of creating good models of themselves and other systems.<br>
&emsp;<i>Unlike many other approaches to computational neuroscience, the challenge is not to emulate a brain, piece by piece, but to find the generative model that describes the problem the brain is trying to solve. Once the problem is appropriately formalized in terms of a generative model, the solution to the problem emerges under Active Inference — with accompanying predictions about
brains and minds. In other words, the generative model provides a complete description of a system of interest. The resulting behavior, inference, and neural dynamics can all be derived from a model by minimizing free energy.</i><br>
&emsp;<i>Getting the generative model right — as an apt explanation for the sentient behavior of any experimental subject or creature — is the big challenge.</i><br>

&emsp; • Parent is a collection of ""tape recordings"" of external influences, a long list of admonitions that a child observed adults doing and saying, and carries with them, such as ""never run out in traffic"" or ""keep smiling""<br>
&emsp; • Child is a collection of ""tape recordings"" of internal events, vivid experiences dating back to childhood, touchstones of how life felt, which a person continues to refer back to<br>

He distinguished three ego states, coherent systems of feelings and behavior patterns, which a person switches between:<br>
&emsp; • Parent - ego states which resemble those of parental figures. Parent functions in raising children and also makes trivial decisions automatic. Parent looks down on Child.<br>
&emsp; • Adult - ego states which are autonomously directed towards objective appraisal of reality. Adult processes data and computes probabilities for complex navigation of the outside world, and also mediates objectively between Parent and Child.<br>
&emsp; • Child - ego states which represent archaic relics, still-active ego states which were fixated in early childhood. Here resides intuition, creativity, spontaneous drive and enjoyment. Child looks up to Parent.<br>

&emsp; • Parent (exteropsyche) is a state in which people mimick their parental figures.<br>
&emsp; • Adult (neopsyche) is a desirable state in which a person resemble an artificially intelligent system, processing information and making predictions how emotions can affect operations, objectively appraising reality.<br>

142;active inference;"The Active Inference textbook explains that this theoretical framework unites and extends three apparently disconnected theoretical perspectives:<br>
&emsp; • enactive theories, emphasizing an organism's autopoietic interactions with its environment, statistically separating internal states from external environment with a Markov blanket, protecting the organism's integrity, self-organizing behavior, keeping its parameters within acceptable bounds, affording reciprocal exchanges between organism and environment.<br>
&emsp; • cybernetic theories, treating behavior as purposive and teleological, regulated by an internal mechanism that continuously tests whether goals are achieved, consequently updating perceptions and steering corrective actions, minimizing the discrepancy between preferred and sensed states, notably the variational free energy, corresponding to prediction error.<br>
&emsp; • predictive theories, emphasizing the development of a good (generative) model of the environment (per the good regulator theorem) used to construct predictions that guide perception and action, evaluate future and counterfactual possibilities, approaching control as a prospective process, established in terms of (approximate) Bayesian inference and (variational and expected) free energy minimization, grounding action in imagination, triggering actions with predictive representations, temporarily attenuating sensory evidence.<br>

We are ‘rule scavengers’, seeking out laws in society to determine what characteristics we should display to fit in[5]. The determination to create rules results in confirmation bias, where information that fits in with preconceived ideas is readily accepted, but information that challenges our beliefs is ignored[6].

Medieval aesthetics in the realm of philosophy built upon Classical thought, continuing the practice of Plotinus by employing theological terminology in its explications. St. Bonaventure's ""Retracing the Arts to Theology"", a primary example of this method, discusses the skills of the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind, which purpose is achieved through four lights: <br>
* the light of skill in mechanical arts which discloses ''the world of artifacts = whether''
* which light is guided by the light of sense perception which discloses ''the world of natural forms = what''<br>
* which light, consequently, is guided by the light of philosophy which discloses ''the world of intellectual truth = how''<br>
* finally, this light is guided by the light of divine wisdom which discloses ''the world of saving truth = why''.<br>

In his famous Essay on the Golden Lion (Taishō no. 1881), Fazang provides a succinct explanation of a key principle of Huayan thought, that of the ultimate principle or pattern (li 理) and the relative phenomena / events / things (shi 事).[52][38] To do this, he uses the statue of a golden lion as a metaphor. According to van Norden: “The gold of the statue is a metaphor for the unified, underlying Pattern of relationships, while the appearance of the statue as a lion is a metaphor for our illusory perception of things as independent individuals. We must recognize that the only thing that ultimately exists is the Pattern of relationships among momentary events. (There is really only gold; there is no lion.) However, we must also acknowledge that it is useful and appropriate to continue to speak as if there were independent, persistent individuals. (The gold really does appear to be a lion.)”.[38] In Huayan Buddhism, li, the principle or pattern is the ultimate reality (paramārtha-satya) which is experienced by Buddhas. According to van Norden, this principle is a ""boundless and ceaseless activity that has a patterned coherence to it"". According to Fazang, Li is boundless and ceaseless, while the phenomena (shi) are impermanent, relative and limited.

Michael Graziano, Consciousness and the Social Brain:<br>
In the case of white light, we can distinguish between four items.<br>
Item I is a real physical thing; a broad spectrum of wavelengths.<br>
Item II is a representation in the brain's visual circuitry, information that stands for, but in many ways depicts something different from, the physical thing. The information depicts a simplified version, minus the physical details that are unimportant for one's own survival, and with no adherence to the laws of physics. To be precise, we can distinguish two parts to Item II, let's say IIa and IIb.  Item IIa is the information itself, which does exist and is instantiated in specialized circuitry of the visual system.  Item IIb is the impossible entity depicted by that information - brightness without color.<br>
Item III is the cognitive access to that representation, the decision-making process that allows the brain to scan the visual representation and abstract properties such as that a white surface is present or has a certain saturation or is located here or there in the environment.<br>
Item IV is the verbal report.
(Whether, what, how, why.  The ""what"" we experience is Item IIb, and it is coded in our brain as Item IIa.)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Heidegger's fourfold aspects of building: receive heaven, await divinities, escort mortals, save earth. See: <br>[[http://mysite.pratt.edu/~arch543p/readings/Heidegger.html | Building Dwelling Thinking]] in Poetry, Language, Thought.  ''But ""on the earth"" already means ""under the sky."" Both of these also mean ""remaining before the divinities"" and include a ""belonging to men's being with one another."" By a primal oneness the four-earth and sky, divinities and mortals-belong together in one.'' Mortals dwell in the way they preserve the fourfold in its essential being, its presencing. Accordingly, the preserving that dwells is fourfold.<br>
Why dwells: The sky is the vaulting path of the sun, the course of the changing, moon, the wandering glitter of the stars, the year's seasons and their changes, the light and dusk of day, the gloom and glow of night, the clemency and inclemency of the weather, the drifting clouds and blue depth of the ether. ... Mortals dwell in that they receive the sky as sky. They leave to the sun and the moon their journey, to the stars their courses, to the seasons their blessing and their inclemency; they do not turn night into day nor day into a harassed unrest.<br>
How dwells: The divinities are the beckoning messengers of the godhead. 0ut of the holy sway of the godhead, the god appears in his presence or withdraws into his concealment. ... Mortals dwell in that they await the divinities as divinities. In hope they hold up to the divinities what is unhoped for. They wait for intimations of their coming and do not mistake the signs of their absence. They do not make their gods for themselves and do not worship idols. In the very depth of misfortune they wait for the weal that has been withdrawn.<br>
* What dwells: The mortals are the human beings. They are called mortals because they can die. To die means to be capable of death as death. Only man dies, and indeed continually, as long as remains on earth, under the sky, before the divinities. ... Mortals dwell in that they initiate their own nature-their being capable of death as death-into the use and practice of this capacity, so that there may be a good death. To initiate mortals into the nature of death in no way means to make death, as empty Nothing, the goal. Nor does it mean to darken dwelling by blindly staring toward the end.<br>
Whether dwells: Earth is the serving bearer, blossoming and fruiting, spreading out in rock and water, rising up into plant and animal. ... Mortals dwell in that they save the earth-taking the word in the old sense still known to Lessing. Saving does not only snatch something from a danger. To save really means to set something free into its own presencing. To save the earth is more than to exploit it or even wear it out. Saving the earth does not master the earth and does not subjugate it, which is merely one step from spoliation.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Gilumas yra tai, kiek daikte atsispindi kitų daiktų. Atspindys - jautriausia vieno daikto egzistavimo kitame forma.

Kodėl - gėris - etika.<br>

Antanas Andrijauskas: Dvasia Kročei yra žmonijos gyvenimas, jos istorija, tiksliau, jos dvasinio gyvenimo istorija. Šis vientisas dvasinis pradas Kročės filosofijoje reiškiasi dviem skirtingomis formomis - teorine ir praktine. Teorine forma žmogus pažįsta pasaulį, o praktine jį keičia. Teorinė forma savo ruožtu skyla į intuityvią, arba, kaip Kročė ją vadina, estetinę ir konceptualią, arba filosofinę, tikrovės pažinimo formą. O praktinė forma skyla į ekonominę ir etinę.

324;William James;"American psychologist William James, a founder of pragmatism, distinguished two philosophical temperaments:<br>
&emsp; • <i>The Tender-Minded: Rationalistic (going by 'principles'), Intellectualistic, Idealistic, Optimistic, Religious, Free-willist, Monistic, Dogmatical.<br>
&emsp; • The Tough-Minded: Empiricist (going by 'facts'), Sensationalistic, Materialistic, Pessimistic, Irreligious, Fatalistic, Pluralistic, Sceptical.</i><br>
&emsp;<i>In manners we find formalists and free-and-easy persons. In government, authoritarians and anarchists. In literature, purists or academicals, and realists. In art, classics and romantics. You recognize these contrasts as familiar; well, in philosophy we have a very similar contrast expressed in the pair of terms 'rationalist' and 'empiricist,' 'empiricist' meaning your lover of facts in all their crude variety, 'rationalist' meaning your devotee to abstract and eternal principles. No one can live an hour without both facts and principles, so it is a difference rather of emphasis; yet it breeds antipathies of the most pungent character between those who lay the emphasis differently; and we shall find it extraordinarily convenient to express a certain contrast in men's ways of taking their universe, by talking of the 'empiricist' and of the 'rationalist' temper.</i><br>
Pragmatism offers a third temperament that mediates between the other two.<br>
&emsp; • <i>The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences. What difference would it practically make to anyone if this notion rather than that notion were true?</i><br>

&emsp; • thinking is the product of Reason, leading beyond knowledge, the inner dialogue, the habit of examining whatever happens or whatever attracts attention, regardless of import, thus dissolving established rules of conduct and habits of thought, and opening up conscience. It takes place in the medium of words and is constrained by non-self-contradiction. It focuses on what is not given by the senses as being more real, truthful, meaningful, aims at contemplation and ends in it.<br>
&emsp; • willing is the product of Freedom, the spring of action, the power of spontaneously beginning a series of successive things or states, bringing about something new, changing the world.<br>
&emsp; • judging is the product of Intellect, formulating the truth, considering particulars without appealing to pre-established universals, allowing one to judge for oneself, yet mindful of all others, sensitive to conscience, rooted in common sense, noncoercive, persuasive, communicable, appraising past actions and establishing future objectives.<br>

This pattern is inevitably temporary for any one individual, and no vortex is permanent, yet the continuance of the pattern forms the matrix within which we have evolved and survive. Our existence takes place within larger systems that self-maintain, and that therefore create and sustain the conditions upon which our own survival, personally, and as a species, depends.

In universal terms, the dissipation of energy through graduated flows is neither beneficial nor harmful. Yet the universe would not exist at all if it were not for the activity that slows or reverses the second law of thermodynamics, albeit temporarily, by creating flux in the flow. In the local, planetary sense, this gradual dissipation of energy is ‘good for’ us, in the sense that it forms the foundation for our survival, giving us time to develop as a culturally sophisticated species with language, technology, and the ability to decide what to value. </i><br>

&emsp; • the dialectical moment, the negatively rational moment, of instability, is the second moment, in which the first moment cancels and preserves itself, in other words, sublates (aufheben) itself, in that its one-sidedness or restrictedness destabilizes its definition and leads it to pass into its opposite.<br>

Many of these axioms occur in opposite pairs as left and right adjoints to a common functor: falsity and truth as left and right adjoints to the terminal functor, disjunction and conjunction as left and right adjoints to the diagonal functor (indeed, discreteness and codiscreteness (total continuitity) as the left and right adjoint of the underlying set functor of a space, which Lawvere would later use to axiomatize what it means to be a category of spaces). This is where we return to Hegel, because the fundamental guiding principle in Hegel's objective logic is the ""unity of opposites.""

The basic idea of a unity of opposites is that in order to entertain any idea, you need to be able to entertain its opposite; otherwise, your idea is vacuous in the sense that it could apply to anything. In fact, Hegel's first unity of opposites is just that: the unity of the opposition between vacuity (applying to nothing) and tautology (applying to anything).<br>

470;Kabbalah;"The Kabbalah posits that the human soul has three elements, which are referred to in Genesis and discussed in the Zohar.<br>
&emsp; • Nefesh (נֶפֶשׁ), the lower soul, the animal part, life-force of the body, aware of the body, given at birth, and dying with the body, the fount of instincts and bodily cravings, which can yet be fully obedient to God<br>
&emsp; • Ruach (רוּחַ), the middle soul, the spirit, which contains the moral virtues and the ability to distinguish between good and evil, by which God is loved with all one's heart, one's emotions<br>
&emsp; • Neshamah (נְשָׁמָה), the higher soul, the super-soul, the intellect, which understands, conceptual grasps, pierces through the ephemeral to the essential, by which the senses are temporarily nullified, making way for love and awe, which separates humans from all other life-forms, which allows humans to enjoy and benefit from the afterlife, which gives humans some awareness of the existence and presence of God<br>
Two further parts of the soul are considered.<br>
&emsp; • Chayyah (חיה) provides awareness of the divine life force itself, by which one loves God with all one's being<br>
&emsp; • Yehidah (יחידה) is the highest plane of the soul, in which one can achieve the fullest union with God that is possible<br>

They see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of representationalism and solipsism. They seek to ""confront the problem of understanding how our existence-the praxis of our living- is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories.... to find a via media: to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment, but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions. Indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves, as describers and observers tells us that our world, as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of human experience when we look at it up close.""[Tree of Knowledge, p. 241] <br>

body (soma)<br>
soul (psyche)<br>
mind (nous)<br>
In the philosophy of Aristotle the soul (psyche) of a body is what makes it alive, and is its actualized form; thus, every living thing, including plant life, has a soul. The mind or intellect (nous) can be described variously as a power, faculty, part, or aspect of the human soul. For Aristotle, soul and nous are not the same. He did not rule out the possibility that nous might survive without the rest of the soul, as in Plato, but he specifically says that this immortal nous does not include any memories or anything else specific to an individual's life. In his Generation of Animals Aristotle specifically says that while other parts of the soul come from the parents, physically, the human nous, must come from outside, into the body, because it is divine or godly, and it has nothing in common with the energeia of the body.<br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
499;Aristotle;"In his Nicomachean Ethics, Book VI Aristotle divides the soul (psychē) into two parts, one which has reason and one which does not, but then divides the part which has reason into the reasoning (logistikos) part itself which is lower, and the higher ""knowing"" (epistēmonikos) part which contemplates general principles (archai).<br>

Nous, he states, is the source of the first principles or sources (archai) of definitions, and it develops naturally as people gain experience.[24] This he explains after first comparing the four other truth revealing capacities of soul: technical know how (technē), logically deduced knowledge (epistēmē, sometimes translated as ""scientific knowledge""), practical wisdom (phronēsis), and lastly theoretical wisdom (sophia), which is defined by Aristotle as the combination of nous and epistēmē. All of these others apart from nous are types of reason (logos).<br>

The production of all thought-forms is based on three major principles:<br>
&emsp; • Quality of thought (the emotional state) determines colour.<br>
&emsp; • Nature of thought (the juxtaposition of states) determines form.<br>
&emsp; • Definiteness of thought (the clarity of representation) determines clearness of outline.<br>

&emsp; • radiating vibration, which resonates with a particular mental body, and more strongly, the more clear it is.<br>
&emsp; • floating form, which is collected by the thought from the strange half-intelligent life which surrounds us, and given a particular shape, and which may hover by its creator, or whichever person it is about, or may otherwise float detached.<br>

563;Theosophy;"From the point of view of the forms which they produce we may group thought into three classes:—

1. That which takes the image of the thinker. When a man thinks of himself as in some distant place, or wishes earnestly to be in that place, he makes a thought-form in his own image which appears there. Such a form has not infrequently been seen by others, and has sometimes been taken for the astral body or apparition of the man himself. In such a case, either the seer must have enough of clairvoyance for the time to be able to observe that astral shape, or the thought-form must have sufficient strength to materialise itself—that is, to draw round itself temporarily a certain amount of physical matter. The thought which generates such a form as this must necessarily be a strong one, and it therefore employs a larger proportion of the matter of the mental body, so that though the form is small and compressed when it leaves the thinker, it draws round it a considerable amount of astral matter, and usually expands to life-size before it appears at its destination.

2. That which takes the image of some material object. When a man thinks of his friend he forms within his mental body a minute image of that friend, which often passes outward and usually floats suspended in the air before him. In the same way if he thinks of a room, a house, a landscape, tiny images of these things are formed within the mental body and afterwards externalised. This is equally true when he is exercising his imagination; the painter who forms a conception of his future picture builds it up out of the matter of his mental body, and then projects it into space in front of him, keeps it before his mind's eye, and copies it. The novelist in the same way builds images of his character in mental matter, and by the exercise of his will moves these puppets from one position or grouping to another, so that the plot of his story is literally acted out before him. With our curiously inverted conceptions of reality it is hard for us to understand that these mental images actually exist, and are so entirely objective that they may readily be seen by the clairvoyant, and can even be rearranged by some one other than their creator. Some novelists have been dimly aware of such a process, and have testified that their characters when once created developed a will of their own, and insisted on carrying the plot of the story along lines quite different from those originally intended by the author. This has actually happened, sometimes because the thought-forms were ensouled by playful nature-spirits, or more often because some 'dead' novelist, watching on the astral plane the development of the plan of his fellow-author, thought that he could improve upon it, and chose this method of putting forward his suggestions.

3. That which takes a form entirely its own, expressing its inherent qualities in the matter which it draws round it. Only thought-forms of this third class can usefully be illustrated, for to represent those of the first or second class would be merely to draw portraits or landscapes. In those types we have the plastic mental or astral matter moulded in imitation of forms belonging to the physical plane; in this third group we have a glimpse of the forms natural to the astral or mental planes. Yet this very fact, which makes them so interesting, places an insuperable barrier in the way of their accurate reproduction.";"";1905;"";;"";"";"";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

seen through the transparent (yet hard and firm) pane seems set apart,
existing
and pulsating as if ""beyond.""
As soon as we open the door, step out of the seclusion and plunge into
the outside reality, we become an active part of this reality and experi-
ence its pulsation with all our senses. The constantly changing grades of
tonality and tempo of the sounds wind themselves about us, rise spirally
and, suddenly, collapse. Likewise, the movements envelop us by a play of

vertical lines
bending
in
different directions,
as colour-
patches pile up and dissolve into high or low tonalities.
The work of Art mirrors itself upon the surface of our consciousness. How-
ever, its image extends beyond, to vanish from the surface without a trace
when the sensation has subsided. A certain transparent, but definite glass-
like partition,
abolishing direct contact from within, seems to exist here
as well. Here, too, exists the possibility of entering art's message, to participate actively, and to experience its pulsating-life with all one's senses.<br>

581;;"According to Meher Baba, each soul pursues conscious divinity by evolving; that is, experiencing itself in a succession of imagined forms through seven ""kingdoms"" of stone/metal, vegetable, worm, fish, bird, animal, and human.[117] The soul identifies itself with each successive form, becoming thus tied to illusion. During this evolution of forms, the power of thought increases, until in human form thought becomes infinite. Although in human form, the soul is capable of conscious divinity, all the impressions that it has gathered during evolution are illusory ones that create a barrier against the soul knowing itself. For this barrier to be overcome, further births in human form are needed in a process known as reincarnation.The soul will reach a stage where its previously gathered impressions grow thin or weak enough that it enters a final stage called involution. This stage also requires a series of human births, during which the soul begins an inner journey, by which it realises its true identity as God.<br>

Maurice Merleau-Ponty<br>
Phenomenology of Perception<br>The essential partiality of the view of things, their being given only in a certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality, but on the contrary establishes it, as there is no other way for things to be copresent in the world and with other things than through such ""Abschattungen"" (sketches, faint outlines, adumbrations). The thing transcends perception, but is manifest precisely by presenting itself to a range of possible views. The object of perception is immanently tied to its background—to the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world. Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations, each object reflects the other (much in the style of Leibniz's monads). Through involvement in the world – being-in-the-world – the perceiver tacitly experiences all the perspectives upon that object coming from all the surrounding things of its environment, as well as the potential perspectives that that object has upon the beings around it.

Each object is a ""mirror of all others"". The perception of the object through all perspectives is not that of a propositional, or clearly delineated, perception; rather, it is an ambiguous perception founded upon the body's primordial involvement and understanding of the world and of the meanings that constitute the landscape's perceptual Gestalt. Only after an integration within the environment so as to perceive objects as such can attention be turned toward particular objects within the landscape so as to define them more clearly. This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new Gestalt oriented toward a particular object. Because the bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, meaningful things are encountered in a unified though ever open-ended world.<br>

&emsp;<i>Every mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a content, direction towards an object (which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself, although they do not all do so in the same way. In presentation something is presented, in judgement something is affirmed or denied, in love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so on. This intentional in-existence is characteristic exclusively of mental phenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything like it. We could, therefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those phenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves.</i><br>

This distinction appears in Phenomenology of Perception (p. 207, 2nd note [Fr. ed.]) and is sometimes repeated in terms of spoken and speaking language (le langage parlé et le langage parlant) (The Prose of the World, p. 10). Spoken language (le langage parlé), or secondary expression, returns to the speaker's linguistic baggage and cultural heritage, as well as the brute mass of relationships between signs and significations. Speaking language (le langage parlant), or primary expression, such as it is, is language in the production of a sense, language at the advent of a thought, at the moment where it makes itself an advent of sense.<br>

590;Lev Vygotsky;"Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky's posthumous book ""Thinking and Speech"" established the connection between speech and the development of mental concepts and awareness. Vygotsky described silent inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech, but both equally important. Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of ""internalization"" (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to ""think out loud"". He claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developed socially.

Inner speech, according to Vygotsky, develops through the accumulation of long-term functional and structural changes. It branches off from the child's external speech along with the differentiation of the social and egocentric functions of speech, and, finally, the speech functions acquired by the child become the main functions of his thinking. In this work, Vygotsky points out the genesis of the development of thinking and speech and that the relationship between them is not a constant value.<br>
&emsp; But since we wanted to express all this in one short formula, in one sentence, we might put it thus: if at the beginning of development there stands the act, independent of the word, then at the end of it there stands the word which becomes the act, the word which makes man's action free.<br>

599;Max Scheler;"Max Scheler, ""Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values""<br>
At our most periphery we have sensible feelings (e.g., a tickle, an itch, a fragrance, a taste, pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst, intoxication…), which manifest in relative modes of joy and suffering. These feelings are shortest in duration, extended and localizable with reference to the lived-body, and are the most readily alterable and accessible through external means and stimuli.<br>
Next we have vital feelings or feeling states of the unitary lived-body which are experienced as a unified field or whole (e.g., comfort, health, vigor, strength, tiredness, illness, weakness, advancing age, phantom limb phenomenon…), and which manifest intentionally as fear and hope.<br>

The remaining two strata of the emotive map belongs to the realm of individual personhood because these emotions transcend (or at least exceed) the physical restrictions of lived-body and environment; they are the least subject to arbitrary alteration; and they are also by their very nature communicable and social in character.
These are, first, the purely psychic feeling states or emotions having a characteristically ego-quality (e.g., euphoria, happiness, sympathy, enjoyment, sadness, sorrow, anger, jealousy…), and which manifest intentionally as empathy, preferring, loving, hating and willing.[17] As representing one’s prevalent mental disposition it is important to note that psychic feeling states are alterable though acts of free will, thought and positive social interactions.<br>
Finally, Scheler identifies spiritual feelings which differ sharply from personal psychic feeling states in that “all ego-states seem to be extinguished… [and such emotions] take possession of the whole of our being.”[18] (e.g., bliss, awe, wonder, catharsis, despair, shame, remorse, anxiety, pangs of conscience, grief…). These types of emotions overtake and overcome us, usually quite unexpectedly. We can not reason or will to produce such spiritual feelings. As positive experiences, we can only open our hearts and mind and hope that they find us.<br>

604;Max Scheler;"Max Scheler. Within the notion of the collective person, Scheler describes three different types: the state (or nation), culture (or people) and the church. The main difference between these three types is the range or extent of responsibility. Every citizen of the state is co-responsible for every other citizen, a limit defined by state or national borders (as well as recognized members of the citizenry). A culture is demarcated by the borders created by shared values, beliefs, and ideas. These borders are often more expansive than a state, but many different cultures can be found in a state. The church is the most expansive of the types of collective persons and includes all finite persons. It is the fullest realization of what Scheler calls “the love community” (Liebesgemeinschaft). The sense of solidarity concerns the salvation of all finite persons, past, present and future. Although these different types of collective persons can be ranked with respect to their related values (life, spirit, holy), they enjoy their own autonomy and Scheler insists upon a clear divide between not only church and state, but also culture and state.

thick description: adds context to such behaviour.<br>

Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul.

631;Harry Collins;"Tacit knowledge can be divided according to the terrain. Terrains affect the process of changing tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. Terrains are of three kinds:<br>
&emsp; • Know how to make explicit, how to explicate. Relational tacit knowledge: Relational tacit knowledge could be made explicit, but not made explicit for reasons that touch on deep principles that have to do with either the nature or location of knowledge of the way humans are made. This knowledge refers to things we could describe in principle if someone put effort into describing them.<br>
&emsp; • Do not know how to make explicit but do know how to explicate. Somatic tacit knowledge: Somatic tacit knowledge has to do with properties of individuals bodies and brains as physical things. It includes things our bodies can do but we cannot describe how, like riding a bike. In principle it is possible for it to be explicated as the outcome of research done by human scientists.<br>
&emsp; • Do not know how to make explicit, do not know how to explicate. Collective tacit knowledge: Collective tacit knowledge is a kind of knowledge that we do not know how to make explicit and that we cannot envisage how to explicate. It is the domain of knowledge that is located in society, such as the rules for language - it has to do with the way society is constituted.<br>

Tacit knowledge can be distinguished from explicit knowledge in three major areas:<br>
&emsp;Codifiability and mechanism of transferring knowledge: Explicit knowledge can be codified (for example, 'can you write it down' or 'put it into words' or 'draw a picture'), and easily transferred without the knowing subject. In contrast, tacit knowledge is intuitive and unarticulated knowledge that cannot be communicated, understood or used without the 'knowing subject'. Unlike the transfer of explicit knowledge, the transfer of tacit knowledge requires close interaction and the buildup of shared understanding and trust among them.<br>
&emsp;Main methods for the acquisition and accumulation: Explicit knowledge can be generated through logical deduction and acquired through practical experience in the relevant context. In contrast, tacit knowledge can only be acquired through practical experience in the relevant context.<br>
&emsp;Potential of aggregation and modes of appropriation: Explicit knowledge can be aggregated at a single location, stored in objective forms, and appropriated without the participation of the knowing subject. Tacit knowledge, in contrast, is personal and contextual; it is distributed across knowing subjects, and cannot easily be aggregated. The realization of its full potential requires the close involvement and cooperation of the knowing subject.<br>
The process of transforming tacit knowledge into explicit or specifiable knowledge is known as codification, articulation, or specification. The tacit aspects of knowledge are those that cannot be codified, but can only be transmitted via training or gained through personal experience.<br>

635;"Ikujiro Nonaka, Hirotaka Takeuchi ";"&emsp;Socialization (Tacit to Tacit) – Socialization is a process of sharing knowledge, including observation, imitation, and practice through apprenticeship. Apprentices work with their teachers or mentors to gain knowledge by imitation, observation, and practice. In effect, socialization is about capturing knowledge by physical proximity, wherein direct interaction is a supported method to acquire knowledge.<br> &emsp;Socialization comes from sharing the experience with others. It also can come from direct interactions with customers and from inside your own organization, just by interacting with another section or working group. For example, brainstorming with colleagues. The tacit knowledge is transferred by common activity in the organizations, such as being together and living in the same environment.<br>
&emsp;Externalization (Tacit to Explicit) – Externalization is the process of making tacit knowledge explicit, wherein knowledge is crystallized and is thus able to be shared by others, becoming the basis of new knowledge. At this point, personal tacit knowledge becomes useful to others as well, because it is expressed in a form that can be interpreted and understood. Concepts, images, and written documents, for example, can support this kind of interaction.<br>
&emsp;Combination (Explicit to Explicit) – Combination involves organizing and integrating knowledge, whereby different types of explicit knowledge are merged (for example, in building prototypes). The creative use of computerized communication networks and large-scale databases can support this mode of knowledge conversion: explicit knowledge is collected from inside or outside the organization and then combined, edited, or processed to form new knowledge. The new explicit knowledge is then disseminated among the members of the organization.<br>
&emsp;Internalization (Explicit to Tacit) – Internalization involves the receiving and application of knowledge by an individual, enclosed by learning-by-doing. On the other hand, explicit knowledge becomes part of an individual's knowledge and will be assets for an organization. Internalization is also a process of continuous individual and collective reflection, as well as the ability to see connections and recognize patterns, and the capacity to make sense between fields, ideas, and concepts.<br>

643;Zohar;"According to the Zohar, a foundational text for kabbalistic thought, Torah study can proceed along four levels of interpretation (exegesis). These four levels are called pardes from their initial letters (PRDS פַּרדֵס‎, 'orchard'):<br>
&emsp; • Peshat (Hebrew: פשט lit. 'simple'): the direct interpretations of meaning.<br>
&emsp; • Remez (רֶמֶז‎ lit. 'hint[s]'): the allegoric meanings (through allusion).<br>

644;;"Moshe Idel writes that these 3 basic models can be discerned operating and competing throughout the whole history of Jewish mysticism, beyond the particular Kabbalistic background of the Middle Ages. They can be readily distinguished by their basic intent with respect to God:<br>
The Theosophical or Theosophical-Theurgic tradition of Theoretical Kabbalah (the main focus of the Zohar and Luria) seeks to understand and describe the divine realm using the imaginative and mythic symbols of human psychological experience. As an intuitive conceptual alternative to rationalist Jewish philosophy, particularly Maimonides' Aristotelianism, this speculation became the central stream of Kabbalah, and the usual reference of the term kabbalah. Its theosophy also implies the innate, centrally important theurgic influence of human conduct on redeeming or damaging the spiritual realms, as man is a divine microcosm, and the spiritual realms the divine macrocosm. The purpose of traditional theosophical kabbalah was to give the whole of normative Jewish religious practice this mystical metaphysical meaning.<br>
The Meditative tradition of Ecstatic Kabbalah (exemplified by Abraham Abulafia and Isaac of Acre) strives to achieve a mystical union with God, or nullification of the meditator in God's Active intellect. Abraham Abulafia's ""Prophetic Kabbalah"" was the supreme example of this, though marginal in Kabbalistic development, and his alternative to the program of theosophical Kabbalah. Abulafian meditation built upon the philosophy of Maimonides, whose following remained the rationalist threat to theosophical Kabbalists.<br>
The Magico-Talismanic tradition of Practical Kabbalah (in often unpublished manuscripts) endeavours to alter both the Divine realms and the World using practical methods. While theosophical interpretations of worship see its redemptive role as harmonising heavenly forces, Practical Kabbalah properly involved white-magical acts, and was censored by Kabbalists for only those completely pure of intent, as it relates to lower realms where purity and impurity are mixed. Consequently, it formed a separate minor tradition shunned from Kabbalah. Practical Kabbalah was prohibited by the Arizal until the Temple in Jerusalem is rebuilt and the required state of ritual purity is attainable.<br>

647;;"The Process of Change Model is divided into four stages: late status quo, chaos, practice and integration, and new status quo.<br>
In the first stage of change, the late status quo, Satir argued the individual is in a predictable environment. Status quo involves a set routine, fixed ideas about the world, and an established behavior. This stage is all about predictability and familiarity.<br>
The second stage of change is chaos. Chaos, as described by Satir, occurs when something in the environment or in the individual changes. This change brings a sense of unfamiliarity and the previously stable routine can no longer be held. In the stage of chaos, here are many strong feelings like sadness, fear, confusion, stress, among others. Satir argues that in the change stage of chaos, therapists must help families and individuals navigate these emotions.<br>
The third stage of change is practice and integration. In this stage new ideas are being implemented and individuals are figuring out what works best. Like any other skill, it requires patience and practice.<br>
The final stage of change is the new status quo. In this stage, the new ideas, behaviors, and changes are not so new anymore. Individuals tend to acclimate to the change, figure out what works, and become better at their new skill.<br>

&emsp; • Dionysian (named after Dionysus, the god of wine-making, orchards and fruit, vegetation, fertility, festivity, insanity, ritual madness, religious ecstasy, and theatre), expressed by the music of the chorus - a state of intoxication, knowledge that actions are powerless, the liberation of instinct and dissolution of boundaries, manifesting disorder, passion, chaos, emotion, ecstasy and unity, the destruction of individuation.<br>
The protagonist of a tragedy struggles but fails to impose Apollonian order on his, unjust, chaotic, Dionysian fate. The audience thus senses the Primordial Unity, experiences the fullness and plentitude of frenzy.<br>

&emsp; • <i>Sensations are forced upon us, coming we know not whence. Over their nature, order, and quantity we have as good as no control. THEY are neither true nor false; they simply ARE. It is only what we say about them, only the names we give them, our theories of their source and nature and remote relations, that may be true or not.<br>
&emsp; • RELATIONS that obtain between our sensations or between their copies in our minds. This part falls into two sub-parts: 1) the relations that are mutable and accidental, as those of date and place; and 2) those that are fixed and essential because they are grounded on the inner natures of their terms—such as likeness and unlikeness. Both sorts of relation are matters of immediate perception. Both are 'facts.' But it is the latter kind of fact that forms the more important sub-part of reality for our theories of knowledge. Inner relations namely are 'eternal,' are perceived whenever their sensible terms are compared; and of them our thought—mathematical and logical thought, so-called—must eternally take account.<br>

The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some ""external"" voice—church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste—is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.</i><br>

675;Dōgen;"Japanese Zen Buddhist monk Dōgen Zenji taught in Instructions for the Cook:<br>
&emsp;<i>When we train in any of the offices of the monastery we should do so with a joyful heart (kishin), a motherly heart (roshin), a vast heart (daishin).</i><br>
&emsp; • <i>A ""joyful heart"" rejoices and recognizes meaning.</i> It is grateful for what is. Feeding and serving others is not simply a job but an unconditional vow, independent of success or failure, an opportunity, <i>using this body which is the fruition of thousands of lifetimes and births to create limitless benefit for numberless beings.</i><br>
&emsp; • <i>A ""motherly heart"" [an old heart] is a heart which maintains the Three Jewels as a parent cares for a child. A parent raises a child with deep love, regardless of poverty or difficulties. Their hearts cannot be understood by another; only a parent can understand it. A parent protects their child from heat or cold before worrying about whether they themselves are hot or cold. This kind of care can only be understood by those who have given rise to it and realized only by those who practice it. This, brought to its fullest, is how you must care for water and rice, as though they were your own children.</i><br>
&emsp; • <i>""Vast heart"" is like a great expanse of ocean or a towering mountain. It views everything from the most inclusive and broadest perspective. This vast heart does not regard a gram as too light or five kilos as too heavy.  It does not follow the sounds of spring or try to nest in a spring garden; it does not darken with the colours of autumn. See the changes of the seasons as all one movement, understand light and heavy in relation to each other within a view which includes both. ... Thus they lived as a great shout of freedom through presenting the Great Matter, penetrating the Great Question, training great disciples and in this way bringing it all forth to us.</i><br>

704;Mary Wollstonecraft;"British author Mary Wollstonecraft, active in public discourse inspired by the French Revolution, championed the education of women.<br>
&emsp;<i>My own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures, instead of flattering their FASCINATING graces, and viewing them as if they were in a state of perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone. I earnestly wish to point out in what true dignity and human happiness consists—I wish to persuade women to endeavour to acquire strength, both of mind and body, and to convince them, that the soft phrases, susceptibility of heart, delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are almost synonymous with epithets of weakness, and that those beings who are only the objects of pity and that kind of love, which has been termed its sister, will soon become objects of contempt.</i><br>

705;Mary Wollstonecraft;"British activist Mary Wollstonecraft appealed to reason in arguing for the education of women as rational companions to men.<br>
&emsp; • <i>In what does man's pre-eminence over the brute creation consist? The answer is as clear as that a half is less than the whole; in Reason.<br>
&emsp; • What acquirement exalts one being above another? Virtue; we spontaneously reply.<br>
&emsp; • For what purpose were the passions implanted? That man by struggling with them might attain a degree of knowledge denied to the brutes: whispers Experience.<br>
&emsp; Consequently the perfection of our nature and capability of happiness, must be estimated by the degree of reason, virtue, and knowledge, that distinguish the individual, and direct the laws which bind society: and that from the exercise of reason, knowledge and virtue naturally flow, is equally undeniable, if mankind be viewed collectively.<br>
&emsp; ...yet such deeply rooted prejudices have clouded reason, and such spurious qualities have assumed the name of virtues, that it is necessary to pursue the course of reason as it has been perplexed and involved in error...<br>
&emsp; Contending for the rights of women, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge, for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate, unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? Unless freedom strengthen her reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations.</i><br>

http://www.ldysinger.com/@texts/0198_galen/03_passions.htm
";;;;"";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
719;Galen;"Galen believed the human body had three interconnected systems that allowed it to work. The first system that he theorized consisted of the brain and the nerves, responsible for thought and sensation. The second theorized system was the heart and the arteries, which Galen believed to be responsible for providing life-giving energy. The last theorized system was the liver and veins, which Galen theorized were responsible for nutrition and growth. Galen also theorized that blood was made in the liver and sent out around the body.<br>
One of Galen's major works, On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato, sought to demonstrate the unity of the two subjects and their views. Using their theories, combined with Aristotle's, Galen developed a tripartite soul consisting of similar aspects. He used the same terms as Plato, referring to the three parts as rational, spiritual, and appetitive. Each corresponded to a localized area of the body. The rational soul was in the brain, the spiritual soul was in the heart, and the appetitive soul was in the liver. Galen was the first scientist and philosopher to assign specific parts of the soul to locations in the body because of his extensive background in medicine.<br>
The rational soul controlled higher level cognitive functioning in an organism, for example, making choices or perceiving the world and sending those signals to the brain.[64] He also listed ""imagination, memory, recollection, knowledge, thought, consideration, voluntary motion, and sensation"" as being found within the rational soul.[64] The functions of ""growing or being alive"" resided in the spirited soul.[64] The spirited soul also contained our passions, such as anger. These passions were considered to be even stronger than regular emotions, and, as a consequence, more dangerous.[64] The third part of the soul, or the appetitive spirit, controlled the living forces in our body, most importantly blood. The appetitive spirit also regulated the pleasures of the body and was moved by feelings of enjoyment. This third part of the soul is the animalistic, or more natural, side of the soul; it deals with the natural urges of the body and survival instincts. Galen proposed that when the soul is moved by too much enjoyment, it reaches states of ""incontinence"" and ""licentiousness"", the inability to willfully cease enjoyment, which was a negative consequence of too much pleasure.<br>
In order to unite his theories about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted the theory of the pneuma, which he used to explain how the soul operated within its assigned organs, and how those organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital pneuma, in the arterial system, from the psychic pneuma, in the brain and nervous system. Galen placed the vital pneuma in the heart and the psychic pneuma (spiritus animalis) within the brain.<br>

721;;"The sympathetic nervous system is often considered the ""fight or flight"" system, while the parasympathetic nervous system is often considered the ""rest and digest"" or ""feed and breed"" system. In many cases, both of these systems have ""opposite"" actions where one system activates a physiological response and the other inhibits it. An older simplification of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems as ""excitatory"" and ""inhibitory"" was overturned due to the many exceptions found. A more modern characterization is that the sympathetic nervous system is a ""quick response mobilizing system"" and the parasympathetic is a ""more slowly activated dampening system"", but even this has exceptions, such as in sexual arousal and orgasm, wherein both play a role.<br>

Sophia is the true conception of the first principles of existence and that which follows from them. This is perfect wisdom, the wisdom of the gods, unattainable by mortal men. This ultimate form of wisdom is sometimes called “Theoretical wisdom” and is often intimately tied to theology.

Phronesis, sometimes translated as “practical wisdom” is the highest level of insight attainable by mortals; the wise deliberation about human affairs.

Ideas form through such associations. education influences those associations. Education influences the associations which result, for the mind as such is an empty cabinet. Furthemore, consciousness is the basis of personal identity, and it travels freely into the past.<br>

&emsp;The overcoming of the world denies the phenomenal world and its distinctions, including the individual. It proclaims a benevolence towards others and an indifference to suffering and change. One achieves serenity by becoming invulnerable to suffering and change. The religion of Buddhism and philosophical thought of Plato and Schopenhauer best represent this orientation.
&emsp;The humanization of the world creates meaning out of social interactions in a meaningless world by placing all emphasis on our reciprocal responsibility to one another. Confucianism and contemporary liberalism represent this strand of thought, both of which aim to soften the cruelties of the world.
&emsp;The struggle with the world is framed by the idea that series of personal and social transformations can increase our share of attributes associated with the divine and give us a larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting the moral of the mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual love. This orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation.<br>

&emsp; • The Imaginary is the field of images and imagination, the signified and signification, generating illusions: synthesis, autonomy, duality and resemblance. It is rooted in one's relationship with their own body, alienation from conflict between one's emotional experience and one's imagine in a mirror, captivation with this image of ""me"", yielding sexual display and courtship love. Its fixations are disabling. It inverts and distorts discourse with a wall of language.<br>
&emsp; • The Symbolic structures the Imaginary order, and is where the analyst produces changes in one's subjective position. It is the world of words (signifiers) that creates the world of things, the discourse of the Other, where elements exist by their mutual differences, the domain of culture, the basis for law which regulate desire, where the drives of death and lack, through repetition, leverage the pleasure principle.<br>
&emsp; • The Real is all that is impossible to imagine or symbolize or attain, for which all words or categories fail, thus traumatic, the essential object that is thus not an object, never missing, always present, positive, in its place.<br>
To these he adds:<br>

797;Paracelsus;"From his study of the elements, Paracelsus adopted the idea of tripartite alternatives to explain the nature of medicines, which he thought to be composed of the tria prima ('three primes' or principles): a combustible element (sulphur), a fluid and changeable element (mercury), and a solid, permanent element (salt). The first mention of the mercury-sulphur-salt model was in the Opus paramirum dating to about 1530. Paracelsus believed that the principles sulphur, mercury, and salt contained the poisons contributing to all diseases. He saw each disease as having three separate cures depending on how it was afflicted, either being caused by the poisoning of sulphur, mercury, or salt. Paracelsus drew the importance of sulphur, salt, and mercury from medieval alchemy, where they all occupied a prominent place. He demonstrated his theory by burning a piece of wood. The fire was the work of sulphur, the smoke was mercury, and the residual ash was salt. Paracelsus also believed that mercury, sulphur, and salt provided a good explanation for the nature of medicine because each of these properties existed in many physical forms. The tria prima also defined the human identity. Salt represented the body; mercury represented the spirit (imagination, moral judgment, and the higher mental faculties); sulphur represented the soul (the emotions and desires). By understanding the chemical nature of the tria prima, a physician could discover the means of curing disease. With every disease, the symptoms depended on which of the three principals caused the ailment. Paracelsus theorized that materials which are poisonous in large doses may be curative in small doses; he demonstrated this with the examples of magnetism and static electricity, wherein a small magnet can attract much larger pieces of metal.<br>

798;Robert Fludd;"While Paracelsian in nature, Fludd's own theory on the origin of all things posited that, instead of the Tria Prima, all species and things stemmed from first, dark Chaos, then divine Light which acted upon the Chaos, which finally brought forth the waters. This last element was also called the Spirit of the Lord, and it made up the passive matter of all other substances, including all secondary elements and the four qualities of the ancients. Moreover, the Fluddean tripartite theory concluded that Paracelsus' own conception of the three primary principles—Sulphur, Salt and Mercury—eventually derived from Chaos and Light interacting to create variations of the waters, or Spirit.<br>

799;Robert Fludd;"Fludd's application of his mystically inclined tripartite theory to his philosophies of medicine and science was best illustrated through his conception of the Macrocosm and microcosm relationship. The divine light (the second of Fludd's primary principles) was the ""active agent"" responsible for creation. This informed the development of the world and the Sun, respectively. Fludd concluded, from a reading of Psalm 19:4—""In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun""—that the Spirit of the Lord was contained literally within the Sun, placing it central to Fludd's model of the macrocosm remained in manuscript. As the Sun was to the Earth, so was the heart to mankind. The Sun conveyed Spirit to the Earth through its rays, which circulated in and about the Earth giving it life. Likewise, the blood of man carried the Spirit of the Lord (the same Spirit provided by the Sun), and circulated through the body of man. This was an application of the sympathies and parallels provided to all of God's Creation by Fludd's tripartite theory of matter.<br>

804;Sydney Banks;"In Three Principles Psychology (TPP), all psychological phenomena—from severe disorders to optimal mental health—are understood as manifestations of three operative ""principles""[8] first articulated by Sydney Banks as the basis of human experience and feeling states.:<br>
&emsp;Mind - The energy and intelligence that animates all life, both in its physical form and in the formless. The Universal Mind, often referred to as ""wisdom"" or the ""impersonal"" mind, is constant and unchanging, acting as the source of innate health and well-being. In contrast, the personal mind is in a continuous state of flux.<br>
&emsp;Consciousness - The capacity to be aware of one's life and experiences. Consciousness is the gift of awareness that enables the recognition of form, with form being an expression of Thought.<br>
&emsp;Thought - The ability to think, which allows individuals to create their personal experience of reality. Thought is a divine gift, not self-created, that is present from birth. It serves as the creative agent through which individuals navigate and direct their lives.<br>
In the TPP model, ""Mind"" is often compared to the electricity powering a movie projector, while ""Thought"" is likened to the images on the film. ""Consciousness"" is analogous to the light from the projector that casts the images onto the screen, making them appear real.<br>

806;Arthur Schopenhauer;" Schopenhauer argues that the world humans experience around them—the world of objects in space and time and related in causal ways—exists solely as ""representation"" (Vorstellung) dependent on a cognizing subject, not as a world that can be considered to exist in itself (i.e., independently of how it appears to the subject's mind). One's knowledge of objects is thus knowledge of mere phenomena rather than things in themselves. Schopenhauer identifies the thing-in-itself — the inner essence of everything — as will: a blind, unconscious, aimless striving devoid of knowledge, outside of space and time, and free of all multiplicity. The world as representation is, therefore, the ""objectification"" of the will. Aesthetic experiences release one briefly from one’s endless servitude to the will, which is the root of suffering. True redemption from life, Schopenhauer asserts, can only result from the total ascetic negation of the ""will to life"".<br>

Kohlberg's approach begins with the assumption that humans are intrinsically motivated to explore and become competent at functioning in their environments. In social development, this leads us to imitate role models we perceive as competent and to look to them for validation.[16] Thus our earliest childhood references on the rightness of our and others' actions are adult role models with whom we are in regular contact. Kohlberg also held that there are common patterns of social life, observed in universally occurring social institutions, such as families, peer groups, structures, and procedures for clan or society decision-making, and cooperative work for mutual defense and sustenance. Endeavoring to become competent participants in such institutions, humans in all cultures exhibit similar actions and thoughts concerning the relations of self, others, and the social world. Furthermore, the more one is prompted to have empathy for the other person, the more quickly one learns to function well in cooperative human interactions. [17]

824;;"Mind is information processor. Cognition is computation. Consciousness is computation.

In philosophy of mind, the computational theory of mind (CTM), also known as computationalism, is a family of views that hold that the human mind is an information processing system and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of computation. It is closely related to functionalism, a broader theory that defines mental states by what they do rather than what they're made of.[1]

Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) were the first to suggest that neural activity is computational. They argued that neural computations explain cognition.[2] The theory was proposed in its modern form by Hilary Putnam in 1967, and developed by his PhD student, philosopher, and cognitive scientist Jerry Fodor in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.[3][4] It was later criticized in the 1990s by Putnam himself, John Searle, and others.

In the end, when the trumpet asks the question for the last time, the strings ""are quietly prolonging their pure G major triad into eternity"".[19] This piece graphically represents the 20th century dichotomy of both tonal and atonal music occurring at the same time.<br>

849;Victor Cousin;"There are three distinctive points in Cousin's philosophy. These are his method, the results of his method, and the application of the method and its results to history, especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis, in fact, a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it is simply a blind and useless syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on which to base his eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system, as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points, the method, the results, and the philosophy of history, are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice Psychology, Ontology and Eclecticism in history.<br>

850;Victor Cousin;"Cousin strongly insisted on the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation, analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin regards as that of the 18th century, the method which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, though imperfectly, and which Thomas Reid and Kant used with more success. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not, through prejudice of system, omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all. If not to be trusted in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness.<br>

A: Adaptation: External problems, instrumental functions. Cognitive symbolization. The capacity of society to interact with the environment. This includes, among other things, gathering resources and producing commodities to social redistribution. Natural resources, commodity production.<br>
G: Goal-attainment: External problems, consummatory functions. Expressive symbolization.  The capability to set goals for the future and make decisions accordingly. Political resolutions and societal objectives are part of this necessity. Religious systems, media. Political offices, common goals.<br>
I: Integration: Internal problems, consummatory functions. Moral-evaluative symbolization. The harmonization of the entire society is a demand that the values and norms of society are solid and sufficiently convergent. This requires, for example, the religious system to be fairly consistent, and even in a more basic level, a common language. This challenges society to maintain the integrative elements of the integration requirement above. This means institutions like family and school, which mediate belief systems and values between an older generation and its successor. Family, schools.<br>

Furthermore, analysing social actions required an understanding of the relevant individuals' subjective motivations.[128] Therefore, his methodology emphasised the use of comparative historical analysis.[129] As such, he was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes than in predicting those processes' outcome in the future.<br>

The ideal type was a central concept in Weber's methodology.[140] He interpreted them as having been indispensable for it.[141] Due their taking of meaning into account, they are unique to the social sciences.[142] The term ""ideal type"" was derived from Georg Jellinek's use of it.[143] Weber outlined it in ""The 'Objectivity' of Knowledge in Social Science and Social Policy"" and the first chapter of Economy and Society.[144] The ideal types' three functions are the formulation of terminology, classifications, and hypotheses. The latter task was of the greatest importance of the three.[145] In terms of their construction, an ideal type is a schematic that represents a social action and considers the role of meaning in it.[146] By its nature, it was an exaggeration of an empirical situation through its assumption that the involved individuals were rational, had complete situational knowledge, were completely aware of the situation, were completely aware of their actions, and made no errors.[145] This was then contrasted with empirical reality, allowing the researcher to better understand it.[147] However, ideal types are not direct representations of reality and Weber warned against interpreting them as such.[148] He placed no limits on what could be analysed through the use of ideal types. Since, for him, rational methodology and science were synonymous with one another, ideal types were constructed rationally<br>

Weber understood rationalisation as having resulted in increasing knowledge, growing impersonality, and the enhanced control of social and material life.[159] He was ambivalent towards rationalisation. Weber admitted that it was responsible for many advances, particularly freeing humans from traditional, restrictive, and illogical social guidelines. However, he also criticised it for dehumanising individuals as ""cogs in the machine"" and curtailing their freedom, trapping them in the iron cage of rationality and bureaucracy.[160] His studies of the subject began with The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.<br>

This danger arises not simply from the creation of separate institutional entities but through the specialisation of cognitive, normative, and aesthetic knowledge that in turn permeates and fragments everyday consciousness. This disunity of reason implies that culture moves from a traditional base in a consensual collective endeavour to forms which are rationalised by commodification and led by individuals with interests which are separated from the purposes of the population as a whole.<br>

861;;"Following Weber again, an increasing complexity arises from the structural and institutional differentiation of the lifeworld, which follows the closed logic of the systemic rationalisation of our communications. There is a transfer of action co-ordination from 'language' over to 'steering media', such as money and power, which bypass consensus-oriented communication with a 'symbolic generalisation of rewards and punishments'. After this process the lifeworld ""is no longer needed for the coordination of action"". This results in humans ('lifeworld actors') losing a sense of responsibility with a chain of negative social consequences. Lifeworld communications lose their purpose becoming irrelevant for the coordination of central life processes. This has the effect of ripping the heart out of social discourse, allowing complex differentiation to occur but at the cost of social pathologies.<br>
Habermas is now ready to make a preliminary definition of the process of communicative rationality: this is communication that is ""oriented to achieving, sustaining and reviewing consensus – and indeed a consensus that rests on the intersubjective recognition of criticisable validity claims"".[28] With this key definition he shifts the emphasis in our concept of rationality from the individual to the social. This shift is fundamental to The Theory of Communicative Action. It is based on an assumption that language is implicitly social and inherently rational.<br>

899;;"Seven Types of Ambiguity is a work of literary criticism by William Empson which was first published in 1930. It was one of the most influential critical works of the 20th century and was a key foundation work in the formation of the New Criticism school. The book is organized around seven types of ambiguity that Empson finds in the poetry he discusses.<br>
&emsp; • The first type of ambiguity is the metaphor, that is, when two things are said to be alike which have different properties. This concept is similar to that of metaphysical conceit.<br>
&emsp; • Two or more meanings are resolved into one. Empson characterizes this as using two different metaphors at once.<br>
&emsp; • Two ideas that are connected through context can be given in one word simultaneously.<br>
&emsp; • Two or more meanings that do not agree but combine to make clear a complicated state of mind in the author.<br>
&emsp; • When the ""author is discovering his idea in the act of writing..."" Empson describes a simile that lies halfway between two statements made by the author.<br>
&emsp; • When a statement says nothing and the readers are forced to invent a statement of their own, most likely in conflict with that of the author.<br>
&emsp; • Two words that within context are opposites that expose a fundamental division in the author's mind.<br>

Each culture, she held, chooses from ""the great arc of human potentialities"" only a few characteristics, which become the leading personality traits of the persons living in that culture. Those traits comprise an interdependent constellation of aesthetics and values in each culture which together add up to a unique gestalt.

For example, she described the emphasis on restraint in Pueblo cultures of the American Southwest and the emphasis on abandon in the Native American cultures of the Great Plains. She used the Nietzschean opposites of ""Apollonian"" and ""Dionysian"" as the stimulus for her thought about these Native American cultures. She describes how in ancient Greece the worshipers of Apollo emphasized order and calm in their celebrations. In contrast, the worshipers of Dionysus, the god of wine, emphasized wildness, abandon, and letting go, like Native Americans. She described in detail the contrasts between rituals, beliefs, and personal preferences among people of diverse cultures to show how each culture had a ""personality,"" which was encouraged in each individual.<br>

(b) patterns for long term evolution towards autonomy;<br>
(c) patterns that lead to the functioning of viable systems.<br>

First suggested by the ecological pscyhologist J.J.Gibson in opposition to the cognitive approach in psychology, affordance remits to a continuum between individual subjectivity and the objectivity of the world around us. In other words, the relation between an agent's abilities and the physical states of its environment, ""the spectrum of expectations with which the agent is endowed"" (Gibson, 1979)<br>
Humans are not 'social' beings by way of brain function but rather the brain is engaged in pluralised enculturation (affordance), thereby extending the Markov blanket. I most humbly offer this as a more cohesive explanation for human cognitive and social behavior.<br>

So for the first time it's a science, it's a discipline, or maybe even an art which is about achieving goals and getting purpose. And this is where it began. But it's everywhere.

956;Gordon Pask;"British cybernetician Gordon Pask overviewed nonclassical versions of cybernetics and general systems theory in presenting his theory of what it means for A and B to agree in understanding.<br>
&emsp;<i>1.1 Organizational Closure as a Stability<br>
&emsp;All of these (mostly independent) formulations replace the classical canons of deterministic or probabilistic stability by organizational closure of a process that is productive and, incidentally, also reproduces the medium, or processor, in which it is executed; most critically, by establishing, or maintaining the distinctions (in biology, the bounding surfaces) required for its coherent execution.<br>
&emsp;1.2 Informationally Open, Organizationally Closed, Processes<br>
&emsp;Another distinctive feature of the nonclassical formulations is that they are generally reflective and relativistic in character, because organizationally closed systems are often informationally open. This point is especially germane to conversation theory, where stable (as a result of organizational closure) units are participants in a conversation that involves information transfer (for example, between A and B) implicating process sharing.<br>
&emsp;1.3 Fundamental Information<br>
&emsp;The word information is used in its most fundamental sense ... to mean either ""emergence of local synchronicity between otherwise asynchronous systems,"" or (equisignificantly) ""emergence of dependency between otherwise independent systems."" Conversely, essential synchronicities in the ongoing process make it necessary to predicate, or to compute, distinctions that render parts of the medium independent; these distinctions being needed if the process is to take place.

960;Deepak Chopra;"Indian American physician Deepak Chopra appealed to the triune brain in teaching the need to consciously, integratively, holistically balance our emotional and rational sides.<br>
&emsp;<i>The classic division of the brain divides it into three parts. The lower or reptilian brain goes back hundreds of millions of years to our animal ancestors. Next in evolutionary time appeared the emotional brain, and finally, the higher brain or neocortex.<br>
&emsp;Studies have shown that decision-making is never completely rational and cannot be turned into a completely rational process. So the real question is whether you are aware of your emotional tendencies – lack of self-awareness has caused more bad decisions than any lapse of rational logic, because without emotion a decision is being made in a vacuum. The human element is mostly emotional and intuitive – it tells us how others feel, how we ourselves feel, where our level of discomfort lies, how well or badly we are communicating, and more.<br>
&emsp;There is no reason to hold a prejudice against any aspect of consciousness, not when you are expanded enough in your awareness to see the bigger picture. art, beauty, truth, love, morality, philosophy, music, invention, curiosity, and creativity are not rational, and it's deeply unwise to dismiss them as irrational as if that must be a derogatory term. If you value insight, if you aspire to wisdom, if you want to make better choices and seek lifelong fulfillment, the starting point is awareness and the holistic brain that supports it.</i><br>

961;Deepak Chopra;"Indian-American meditator Deepak Chopra distinguishes three minds.<br>
&emsp; • <i>Conditioned mind is karma, samskara and vasana. ... Conditioning simply means the modification of consciousness into predictable patterns of thought, feeling, behavior, speech, habits. So this is a recycling of experience and the interpretation of experience.<br>
&emsp; • The entangled mind is synchronicity, meaningful coincidence, and spontaneous fulfillment of desire. ... a mind that is expressed through non-local correlation or synchronicity. It is a deeper knowing in this submanifest order being also that that we are all entangled with each other ... Our collective desires, our collective fears, but also our collective archetypes, and, our collective aspirations, our collective longings, all of which influence the ecosystem of relationship.<br>
&emsp; • The free mind is spontaneous creativity and liberation from all suffering. ... The free mind is the source of all experience, without any conditioning, even before the entanglement. And this source of experience, as I have said, is always a field of infinite possibilities, a field of unpredictability connected to the uncertainty principle, a field of pure creativity, a field of pure evolution, a field of pure self-regulation. That field, which is without cause, spaceless, timeless, incomprehensible, unimaginable, fundamental, infinite, borderless and fundamental.<br>
&emsp;Now, the conditioned mind can be overcome through conscious choice-making. And so before you make any choice, ask yourself the consequences of the choice.</i><br>

968;;"Advaita is often translated as ""non-duality,"" but a more apt translation is ""non-secondness.""[3] Advaita has several meanings:

Nonduality of subject and object[47][48][web 2] As Gaudapada states, when a distinction is made between subject and object, people grasp to objects, which is samsara. By realizing one's true identity as Brahman, there is no more grasping, and the mind comes to rest.[48]
Advaita Vedanta is a Hindu sādhanā, a path of spiritual discipline and experience,[note 3] and states that moksha (liberation from suffering and rebirth)[14][15] is attained through knowledge of Brahman, recognizing the illusoriness of the phenomenal world and disidentification from the body-mind complex and the notion of 'doership',[note 4] and acquiring vidyā (knowledge)[16] of one's true identity as Atman-Brahman,[1][17][18][19] self-luminous (svayam prakāśa)[note 5] awareness or Witness-consciousness.<br>
Nonduality of Atman and Brahman, the famous diction of Advaita Vedanta that Atman is not distinct from Brahman; the knowledge of this identity is liberating.
Monism: there is no other reality than Brahman, that ""Reality is not constituted by parts,"" that is, ever-changing 'things' have no existence of their own, but are appearances of the one Existent, Brahman; and that there is in reality no duality between the ""experiencing self"" (jiva) and Brahman, the Ground of Being.<br>

969;Buddhism;"Kaccāna, this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence. But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won't have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won't have the notion of existence regarding the world. The world is for the most part shackled by attraction, grasping, and insisting. But if—when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency—you don't get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion 'my self', you'll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing.

&emsp;<i>Facts are dead, and the vibe is king. ...The story of vibes begins with the release of the Beach Boys’ Good Vibrations in 1966. That was where the vibe chilled, for decades: West-Coast-specific, surf-adjacent, self-consciously laid-back. Quincy Jones launched Vibe magazine in 1993, when hip-hop was still a subculture, and the meaning of vibe began to expand. A graph of the word ‘vibes’ on Google Trends shows it begins to move from the alternative to the mainstream around 2016. Having hummed around the edges of culture for half a century, vibes began to gather steam. Louise Yems, strategy director of creative agency The Digital Fairy, believes the rise of vibes “speaks to how our reduced attention spans have led to a shortening of language. We use fewer words to capture something bigger than the words themselves.” Sometime around the early 2010s, the media started talking about places, bands, hotels having “a cool vibe”, or “an uptown vibe”.</i><br>

&emsp;<i>One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.<br>
&emsp;I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.<br>
&emsp;A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.<br>
&emsp;He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.<br>
&emsp;She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.<br>
&emsp;Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,—“did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?” She explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.</i><br>

It generally refers to the ability to give the “correct” answer to standard questions that do not require significant creativity. This includes most tasks in school and on standardized tests. Convergent thinking is the type of thinking that focuses on coming up with the single, well-established answer to a problem. When an individual is using convergent thinking to solve a problem, they consciously use standards or probabilities to make judgments.<br> 
&emsp; • Divergent thinking (using imagination). This type of thinking is also called creative or horizontal thinking. It is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. When a student uses divergent thinking, thoughts typically occur in a spontaneous, free-flowing way. Many possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are more easily drawn. After the process of divergent thinking has been completed, ideas and information are organized and structured using convergent thinking.<br>
&emsp; • Lateral thinking (using both logic and imagination). This type of thinking is commonly referred to as “thinking outside the box.” It involves solving problems through an indirect and creative approach, using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and involving ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step-by-step logic. To understand lateral thinking, it is necessary to compare convergent and divergent thinking and build a working relationship between the two types.</i><br>

<i>
Good leadership constantly requires a careful, ongoing evaluation of a vision of the future to which one can navigate. Many leaders are guided by the mechanistic world-view that projects a future horizon from the consciousness of our past—a forecast. This approach of forecasting holds serious limitations that prevent us from predicting the distant horizons. This article outlines the three horizons for our journey into the future. To co-evolve synergistically and harmoniously with the emerging future, we need to steer at three levels of consciousness. The first two levels project the forecast of the first horizon and the foresight of the second horizon, respectively. The third level is the most challenging. It requires us to “be in the present” to enable us to foreknow the distant future. These trajectories to the three horizons are not separate or sequential. They are complimentary, iterative, and recursive.<br>
&emsp;The First Horizon: Our past consciousness projects the forecast of the immediate future. Past becomes the stimulus for the future. It resides in the realm of mechanistic worldview and logical analysis—the logos—left-brain dominance. It is guided by problem-solving intervention.<br>
&emsp;The Second Horizon: Insight or intuition, drawn from our mythic past—the collective unconscious—projects the foresight of a distant horizon. It resides in the holistic paradigm—the right-brain dominance and the mythos. It is facilitated by the interplay of polarities and paradoxes.<br>
&emsp;The Third Horizon: Foreknowledge of the distant future can be experienced by being in the present—contraction of time and “self” (in humility), and expansion of “self” (in compassion). This resides in the co-evolutionary paradigm and mystical realm—the mystikos. It can be facilitated through an authentic dialogue.</i><br>

Systems Thinking (i.e., the act of considering whole systems) is a necessary skillset for effective structural leadership.

So. What exactly is Systems Thinking?

&emsp;<i>1. Stocks and Flows. “Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the mechanisms for regulating the levels in the stocks by manipulating flows.” ― Donella H. Meadows

At the most basic level, Systems Theory teaches us that complex systems are made up of stocks and flows. Take your bank account as an example. The state of that system is the amount of money you have in stock. And each time you make a deposit or a withdrawal, money either flows in or out of that stock — changing the system’s state over time. Trust is another good example. If trust was a battery (as Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke is fond of saying), that battery would either charge or discharge depending on your interactions with other people. And the state the system — its stock — is the amount of trust you managed to accumulate and retain over time.<br>

&emsp;2. Feedback Loops. “You think that because you understand ‘one’ that you must therefore understand ‘two’ because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand ‘and.’” ― Donella H. Meadows

Complex systems are complex because they contain stocks and flows on the one hand, and a myriad of interconnections on the other. Imagine, if you will, that you’ve manage to accumulate a bit of money in your bank account. If you’re like most people, you might use this as an excuse to spend a little more as well — buying that new phone you’ve been wanting. This “perceived state” is a negative feedback loop. The more money you have in your account, the more money you are likely to spend. And this is true for trust as well: the more trust you’ve got built up with another person, the more likely you are to ask them for favors. You save and you spend. The system self regulates.<br>
&emsp; 3. Leverage Points
“If you define the goal of a society as GNP, that society will do its best to produce GNP. It will not produce welfare, equity, justice, or efficiency”. ― Donella H. Meadows

Every system has a purpose. That is, its stocks, flows, and interconnections are organized to produce a certain outcome. You can influence that outcome by way of targeted interventions. In the case of the economy, you can for example tweak the interest rate. An increase will remove money from circulation (money flows into your account). A decrease will stimulate consumption (money flows out of your account). Whether you find this desirable or not depends on your point of view (good for you, bad for society). And that is the most potent leverage point of all: no intervention is as powerful as changing the intended output. Just imagine an economy designed for happiness rather than growth!

I got my first exposure to Systems Thinking back in 2014 courtesy of Donella H. Meadows’ book Thinking in Systems: A Primer (from which I’ve sourced the above quotes). And if you want more information on leverage points, I can recommend this essay — also penned by Meadows and recommended by fellow Systems Thinker Christopher McCann (Thanks Chris!).

Next week’s issue will seize on the above notion of “intended output” to talk about disruptive innovation. As it happens, Systems Thinking provides a great backdrop for understanding this illusive and much sought after ideal.</i><br>

1007;Cognitive behavioral therapy;"Californian Cognitive behaviorial therapists Albert Bonfil and Suraji Wagage describe a basic model of emotional experience in terms of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors:<br>
&emsp; • <i>Thoughts refer to the ways that we make sense of situations. Thoughts can take a number of forms, including verbal forms such as words, sentences, and explicit ideas, as well as non-verbal forms such as mental images. Thoughts are the running commentary we hear in our minds throughout our lives.<br>
&emsp; • The term feelings here doesn’t refer to emotion, but the physiological changes that occur as a result of emotion. For instance, when we feel the emotion of anger, we have the feeling of our face flushing. When we feel the emotion of anxiety, we have the feelings of our heart pounding and muscles tensing. Feelings are the hard-wired physical manifestation of emotion.<br>
&emsp; • Behaviors are simply the things we do. Importantly, behaviors are also the things we don’t do. For instance, we might bow out of a speaking engagement if we feel overwhelming anxiety. On the other hand, if instead we feel confident, we might actually seek out those sorts of engagements.</i><br>

1026;Alexander Grothendieck;"<i>It is traditional to distinguish three kinds of ""qualities"" or ""aspects"" of things in the Universe which adapt themselves to mathematical reflections. These are (1) Number(**); (2) Magnitude and (3) Form<br>
&emsp;One can also speak of them as the ""arithmetical aspect"", the ""metric aspect"" and the ""geometric aspect"" of things. In most of the situations studied in mathematics, these three aspects are simultaneously present in close interaction. Most often, however, one finds that one or another of them will predominate. It's my impression that for most mathematicians its quite clear to them ( for those at least who are in touch with their own work) if they are ""arithmeticians"", ""analysts"", or ""geometers"", and this remains the case no matter how many chords they have on their violin, or if they have played at every register and diapason imaginable.<br>
&emsp;The year 1955 marked a critical departure in my work in mathematics: that of my passage from ""analysis"" to ""geometry"". I well recall the power of my emotional response ( very subjective naturally); it was as if I'd fled the harsh arid steppes to find myself suddenly transported to a kind of ""promised land"" of superabundant richness, multipying out to infinity wherever I placed my hand in it, either to search or to gather... <br>
That is to say that, if there is one thing in Mathematics which ( no doubt this has always been so) fascinates me more than anything else, it is neither ""number"", nor ""magnitude"" but above all ""form"". And. among the thousand and one faces that form chooses in presenting itself to our attention, the one that has fascinated me more than any other, and continues to fascinate me, is the structure buried within mathematical objects.
One cannot invent the structure of an object. The most we can do is to patiently bring it to the light of day, with humility - in making it known it is ""discovered"". If there is some sort of inventiveness in this work, and if it happens that we find ourselves the maker or indefatigable builder, we aren't in any sense ""making"" or ""building"" these structures. They hardly waited for us to find them in order to exist, exactly as they are! But it is in order to express, as faithfully as possible, the things that we've been detecting or discovering, to deliver up that reticent structure, which we can only grasp at, perhaps with a language no better than babbling. Thereby are we constantly driven to invent the language most appropriate to express, with increasing refinement, the intimate structure of the mathematical object, and to ""construct"" with the help of this language, bit by bit, those ""theories"" which claim to give a fair account of what has been apprehended and seen.<br>
And the most beautiful mansion, the one that best reflects the love of the true workman, is not the one that is bigger or higher than all the others. The most beautiful mansion is that which is a faithful reflection of the structure and beauty concealed within things.

1027;Alexander Grothendieck;"French mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, reflecting on his life work and its unifying vision.<br>
<i>&emsp; • One might say that ""Number"" is what is appropriate for grasping the structure of ""discontinuous"" or ""discrete"" aggregates. These systems, often finite, are formed from ""elements"", or ""objects"" conceived of as isolated with respect to one another.<br>
&emsp; • ""Magnitude"" on the other hand is the quality, above all, susceptible to ""continuous variation"", and is most appropriate for grasping continous structures and phenomena: motion, space, varieties in all their forms, force fields, etc. Thereby , Arithmetic appears to be ( overall) the science of discrete structures while Analysis is the science of continuous structures.<br>
&emsp; • As for Geometry, one can say that in the two thousand years in which it has existed as a science in the modern sense of the word, it has ""straddled"" these two kinds of structure, ""discrete"" and ""continuous"".<br>
&emsp; For some time in fact one can say that the two geometries considered to be distinct species, the discrete and the continuous, weren't really ""divorced"". They were rather two different ways of investigating the same class of geometric objects: one of them accentuated the ""discrete"" properties ( notably computational and combinatorial) while the other concerned itself with the ""continuous"" properties ( such as location in an ambient space, or the measurement of ""magnitude"" in terms of the distances between points, etc.)<br>
&emsp; It was at the end of the last century that a divorce became immanent, with the arrival and development of what came to be called"" Abstract (Algebraic) Geometry"". Roughly speaking, this consisted of introducing, for every prime number p, an algebraic geometry ""of characteristic p"", founded on the model (continous) of the Geometry ( algebraic) inherited from previous centuries, however in a context which appeared to be resolutely ""discontinuous"", or ""discrete"".</i><br>

1029;Robert Brandom;"American philosopher Robert Brandom advocated that the meaning of an expression is determined by how it is used in inferences.<br>
&emsp;<i>Making It Explicit is an investigation into the nature of language--the social practices that distinguish us as rational, logical creatures--that revises the very terms of this inquiry. Where accounts of the relation between language and mind have traditionally rested on the concept of representation, this book sets out an alternate approach based on inference, and on a conception of certain kinds of implicit assessment that become explicit in language. Making It Explicit is the first attempt to work out in detail a theory that renders linguistic meaning in terms of use--in short, to explain how semantic content can be conferred on expressions and attitudes that are suitably caught up in social practices.<br>
&emsp;At the center of this enterprise is a notion of discursive commitment. Being able to talk--and so in the fullest sense being able to think--is a matter of mastering the practices that govern such commitments, being able to keep track of one’s own commitments and those of others. Assessing the pragmatic significance of speech acts is a matter of explaining the explicit in terms of the implicit. As he traces the inferential structure of the social practices within which things can be made conceptually explicit, the author defines the distinctively expressive role of logical vocabulary. This expressive account of language, mind, and logic is, finally, an account of who we are.</i><br>

&emsp;Yet he considered himself a slow man, poor in emergencies.<br>
&emsp;Once he told me that, being so slow-thinking, he had to guide his acts by a general intuition of which way his ""luck"" was running, and that this intuition rarely failed him. He said it seriously; it may have been true. The Foretellers of the Fastnesses are not the only people on Winter who can see ahead. They have tamed and trained the hunch, but not increased its certainty.

1033;Ursula K. Le Guin;"American author Ursula K. Le Guin speculates about a world where individuals are all sexually the same, experiencing sexual attraction only once a month, at which time they randomly manifest male or female characteristics.<br>

dominant/submissive, owner/chattel, active/passive. In fact the whole tendency to dualism that
pervades human thinking may be found to be lessened, or changed, on Winter.<br>
&emsp;Another guess concerning the hypothetical experiment's object: The elimination of war. Did
the Ancient Hainish postulate that continuous sexual capacity and organized social aggression,
neither of which are attributes of any mammal but man, are cause and effect? Or, like Tumass
Song Angot, did they consider war to be a purely masculine displacement-activity, a vast Rape,
and therefore in their experiment eliminate the masculinity that rapes and the femininity that is
raped?<br>
&emsp;The weather of Winter is so relentless, so
near the limit of tolerability even to them with all their cold-adaptations, that perhaps they use
up their fighting spirit fighting the cold. The marginal peoples, the races that just get by, are
rarely the warriors. And in the end, the dominant factor in Gethenian life is not sex or any other
human thing: it is their environment, their cold world. Here man has a crueler enemy even than
himself.</i><br>

&emsp;<i>I was galled by his patronizing. He was a head shorter than I, and built more like a woman than a man, more fat than muscle; when we hauled together I had to shorten my pace to his, hold in my strength so as not to out-pull him: a stallion in harness with a mule-<br>
&emsp;He had not meant to patronize. He had thought me sick, and sick men take orders. He was frank, and expected a reciprocal frankness that I might not be able to supply. He, after all, had no standards of manliness, of virility, to complicate his pride.<br>

He goes on and gives further stages that might sometimes take place:<br>
Proofs of other theorems are examined to see if the newly found lemma or the new proof-generated concept occurs in them: this concept may be found lying at cross-roads of different proofs, and thus emerge as of basic importance.<br>

1057;economics;"The subjective theory of value (STV) is an economic theory for explaining how the value of goods and services are not only set but also how they can fluctuate over time. The contrasting system is typically known as the labor theory of value.<br>
&emsp;According to the subjective theory of value, by assuming that all trades between individuals are voluntary, it can be concluded that both parties to the trade subjectively perceive the goods, labour or money they receive, as being of higher value to the goods, labour or money they give away. The theory holds that one can create value simply by trading with someone who values the items higher, without necessarily modifying them. Wealth is understood to refer to individuals' subjective valuation of their possessions, and voluntary trades may increase the total wealth in society.[5] This is because each participant of the voluntary transaction has gained more value than they originally had.<br>
&emsp;The labor theory of value argues that the exchange value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of ""socially necessary labor"" required to produce it. value refers to the amount of socially necessary labor to produce a marketable commodity; According to Ricardo and Marx, this includes the labor components necessary to develop any real capital (i.e., physical assets used to produce other assets).[4][5] Including these indirect labour components, sometimes described as ""dead labour,""[6] provides the ""real price,"" or ""natural price"" of a commodity. However, Adam Smith's version of labor value does not implicate the role of past labor in the commodity itself or in the tools (capital) required to produce it.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value<br>

The word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called ""value in use;"" the other, ""value in exchange."" The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarcely anything; scarcely anything can be had in exchange for it.

Americans and Europeans alike sometimes forget how unique is the United States of America. No other nation has been created so swiftly and successfully.

Both the founding fathers of the United [end p22] States and successive waves of immigrants to your country were determined to create a new identity. Whether in flight from persecution or from poverty, the huddled masses have, with few exceptions, welcomed American values, the American way of life and American opportunities. And America herself has bound them to her with powerful bonds of patriotism and pride.<br>
The European nations are not and can never be like this. They are the product of history and not of philosophy. You can construct a nation on an idea; but you cannot reconstruct a nation on the basis of one.<br>

The three beasts, taken from Jeremiah 5:6,[12] are thought to symbolize the three kinds of sin that bring the unrepentant soul into one of the three major divisions of Hell.

These sinners endure lesser torments than do those consigned to Lower Hell, located within the walls of the City of Dis, for committing acts of violence and fraud – the latter of which involves, as Dorothy L. Sayers writes, ""abuse of the specifically human faculty of reason"".[26] The deeper levels are organised into one circle for violence (Circle 7) and two circles for fraud (Circles 8 and 9). As a Christian, Dante adds Circle 1 (Limbo) to Upper Hell and Circle 6 (Heresy) to Lower Hell, making 9 Circles in total; incorporating the Vestibule of the Futile, this leads to Hell containing 10 main divisions.<br>

1077;T.S. Eliot;"American English poet T.S.Eliot wrote a book about how he personally drew from Italian poet Dante Alighieri, a forerunner of the Renaissance.<br>
&emsp;<i>I do not recommend, in first reading the first canto of the</i> Inferno<i>, worrying about the identity of the Leopard, the Lion, or the She-Wolf. It is really better, at the start, not to know or care what they do mean. What we should consider is not so much the meaning of the images, but the reverse process, that which led a man having an idea to express it in images. We have to consider the type of mind which by nature and </i>practice<i> tended to express itself in allegory: and for a competent poet, allegory means </i>clear visual images<i>. And clear visual images are given much more intensity by having a meaning—we do not need to know what that meaning is, but in our awareness of the image we must be aware that the meaning is there too. Allegory is only one poetic method, but it is a method which has very great advantages.<br>
&emsp;Dante’s is a </i>visual<i> imagination. It is a visual imagination in a different sense from that of a modern painter of still life: it is visual in the sense that he lived in an age in which men still saw visions. It was a psychological habit, the trick of which we have forgotten, but as good as any of our own. We have nothing but dreams, and we have forgotten that seeing visions—a practice now relegated to the aberrant and uneducated—was once a more significant, interesting, and disciplined kind of dreaming. We take it for granted that our dreams spring from below: possibly the quality of our dreams suffers in consequence.<br>
&emsp;All that I ask of the reader, at this point, is to clear his mind, if he can, of every prejudice against allegory, and to admit at least that it was not a device to enable the uninspired to write verses, but really a mental habit, which when raised to the point of genius can make a great poet as well as a great mystic or saint. And it is the allegory which makes it possible for the reader who is not even a good Italian scholar to enjoy Dante. Speech varies, but our eyes are all the same. And allegory was not a local Italian custom, but a universal European method.</i><br>

1080;economics;"The International Monetary Fund explains the methodology of econometrics as follows.<br>
&emsp;<i>The first step is to suggest a theory or hypothesis to explain the data being examined. The explanatory variables in the model are specified, and the sign and/or magnitude of the relationship between each explanatory variable and the dependent variable are clearly stated. At this stage of the analysis, applied econometricians rely heavily on economic theory to formulate the hypothesis<br>
&emsp;The second step is the specification of a statistical model that captures the essence of the theory the economist is testing. The model proposes a specific mathematical relationship between the dependent variable and the explanatory variables—on which, unfortunately, economic theory is usually silent. By far the most common approach is to assume linearity—meaning that any change in an explanatory variable will always produce the same change in the dependent variable (that is, a straight-line relationship).<br>
&emsp;The third step involves using an appropriate statistical procedure and an econometric software package to estimate the unknown parameters (coefficients) of the model using economic data. This is often the easiest part of the analysis thanks to readily available economic data and excellent econometric software. Still, the famous GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) principle of computing also applies to econometrics.<br>
&emsp;The fourth step is by far the most important: administering the smell test. Does the estimated model make economic sense—that is, yield meaningful economic predictions?<br>
&ęmsp;If the estimated parameters do not make sense, how should the econometrician change the statistical model to yield sensible estimates?</i><br>

Developed by science and technology studies (STS) scholars Michel Callon, Madeleine Akrich and Bruno Latour, the sociologist John Law, and others, it can more technically be described as a ""material-semiotic"" method. This means that it maps relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and semiotic (between concepts). It assumes that many relations are both material and semiotic. The term actor-network theory was coined by John Law in 1992 to describe the work being done across case studies in different areas at the Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation at the time.

Gossen evidently held the highest possible opinion of the importance of his own theory, for he commences by claiming honours in economic science equal to those of Copernicus in astronomy. He then at once insists that mathematical treatment, being the only sound one, must be applied throughout ; but, out of consideration for the reader, the higher analysis will be explicitly introduced only when it is requisite to determine maxima and minima. The treatise then opens with the consideration of Economics as the theory of pleasure and pain, that is as the theory of the procedure by which the individual and the aggregate of individuals constituting society, may realise the maximum of pleasure with the minimum of painful effort. The natural law of pleasure is then clearly stated, somewhat as follows:—Increase of the same hind of consumption yields pleasure continuously diminishing up to the point of satiety.

4.2 Integral Science 
Epistemologically, humans perceive reality or nature from different positions. To 
think as an artist, or scientist, or design scientist (designer) is not neutral, but 
contains a standpoint and thus a philosophical position. Cf. Harding (1998) for 
more on standpoint epistemology and science. The presence of these varied 
standpoints becomes clear upon reading texts produced by practitioners or 
talking with those self-describing as scientists, artists, or designers.<br>
In my relational ontology, we can think of different domains in how we approach the 
world. These domains include science, art, design science, though others can be considered, 
e.g., spirituality. It is possible to operate in a way that is inclusive of these different domains. 
You can have a religious artist, for example. Thinking in terms of domains is not common. 
The inter-domain approach can be seen in the way of Leonardo da Vinci called saper vedere 
(knowing how to see) (Gelb, 1998). “To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; 
Study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything 
else.” Is a quote attributed to Leonardo that summarizes this idea (Pasipoularides, 2019; 
Kinsman, 1989), though I can find no original source of Leonardo writing or reported as 
saying exactly these words in any language. For more on da Vinci’s approach, see his Note
books (2020 [1883]), and A Treatise on Painting (2014 [1802]).<br>

&emsp;<i>Even apart from the instability due to speculation, there is the instability due to the characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than on a mathematical expectation, whether moral or hedonistic or economic. Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spirits – of a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.<br>
&emsp;This means, unfortunately, not only that slumps and depressions are exaggerated in degree, but that economic prosperity is excessively dependent on a political and social atmosphere which is congenial to the average business man. If the fear of a Labour Government or a New Deal depresses enterprise, this need not be the result either of a reasonable calculation or of a plot with political intent; - it is the mere consequence of upsetting the delicate balance of spontaneous optimism.</i><br>

&emsp;<i> • What did human souls experience previously? They experienced pictures; all their experience of the external world took the form of pictures. I have often spoken of this from certain points of view. This picture-experience is the last phase of the old clairvoyant experience.<br>
&emsp; • The development of thought leads to a stage of doubting the existence of what are called “universals”, general concepts, and thus to so-called Nominalism, the view that universals can be no more than “names”, nothing but words. ... The collective or general triangle must contain everything that a triangle can contain. But a triangle that is acute-angled cannot be at the same time right-angled and obtuse-angled. Hence there cannot be a collective triangle. ... There are only separate things; and beyond the separate things—so says the Nominalist—we have nothing but words that comprise the separate things.<br>
&emsp; • I will not only draw a triangle and let it stay as it is, but I will make certain demands on your imagination. You must think to yourself that the sides of the triangle are in continual motion. When they are in motion, then out of the form of the movements there can arise simultaneously a right-angled, or an obtuse-angled triangle, or any other. ... If we are to rise from the specific thought to the general thought, we have to bring the specific thought into motion; thus thought in movement becomes the “general thought” by passing constantly from one form into another.<br>

1098;Rudolf Steiner;"Rudolf Steiner<br>
Man experiences within himself what we may call thought, and in thought he can feel himself directly active, able to exercise his activity. When we observe anything external, e.g. a rose or a stone, and picture it to ourselves, someone may rightly say: “You can never know how much of the stone or the rose you have really got hold of when you imagine it. You see the rose, its external red colour, its form, and how it is divided into single petals; you see the stone with its colour, with its several corners, but you must always say to yourself that hidden within it there may be something else which does not appear to you externally. You do not know how much of the rose or of the stone your mental picture of it embraces.”<br>
But when someone has a thought, then it is he himself who makes the thought. One might say that he is within every fiber of his thought, a complete participator in its activity. He knows: “Everything that is in the thought I have thought into it, and what I have not thought into it cannot be within it. I survey the thought. Nobody can say, when I set a thought before my mind, that there may still be something more in the thought, as there may be in the rose and in the stone, for I have myself engendered the thought and am present in it, and so I know what is in it.”<br>
In truth, thought is most completely our possession. If we can find the relation of thought to the Cosmos, to the Universe, we shall find the relation to the Cosmos of what is most completely ours. This can assure us that we have here a fruitful standpoint from which to observe the relation of man to the universe. We will therefore embark on this course; it will lead us to significant heights of anthroposophical observation.<br>

&emsp;<i>Like all of Fichte’s systematic treatises of the Jena period, The System of Ethics begins with a detailed analysis of what is involved in the self-positing of the I. In this case, the focus is upon the necessity that the I posit for itself its own activity or “efficacy,” and upon a detailed analysis of the conditions for doing this. In this manner Fichte deduces what he calls “the principle of all practical philosophy,” viz., that something objective (a being) follows from something subjective (a concept), and hence that the I must ascribe to itself a power of free purposiveness or causality in the sensible world. The I must posit itself as an embodied will, and only as such does it “discover” itself at all. From this starting point Fichte then proceeds to a deduction of the principle of morality: namely, that I must think of my freedom as standing under a certain necessary law or categorical imperative, which Fichte calls “the law of self-sufficiency” or “autonomy,” and that I ought always to determine my freedom in accordance with this law. This, therefore, is the task of the philosophical science of “ethics,” as understood by Fichte: to provide an a priori deduction of our moral nature in general and of our specific duties as human beings. Viewed from the perspective of practical philosophy, the world really is nothing more than what Fichte once described as “the material of our duty made sensible,” which is precisely the viewpoint adopted by the morally engaged, practically striving subject.</i><br>

1121;Buckminster Fuller;"537.15 A basic event consists of three vectorial lines: the action, the reaction,
and the resultant. This is the fundamental tripartite component of Universe. One
positive and one negative event together make one tetrahedron, or one quantum.
The number of vectors (or force lines) cohering each and every subsystem of
Universe is always a number subdivisible by six, i.e., consisting of one positive
and one negative event on each of three vectors, which adds up to six. This holds
true topologically in all abstract patterning in Universe as well as in fundamental
physics. The six vectors represent the fundamental six, and only six, degrees of
freedom in Universe. Each of these six, however, has a positive and a negative
direction, and we can therefore speak of a total of 12 degrees of freedom. These
12 degrees of freedom can be conceptually visua!ized as the radial lines
connecting the centers of gravity of the 12 spheres, closest packed around one
sphere, to the center of gravity of that central sphere. The 12 degrees of freedom
are also identified by the push- pull alternative directions of the tetrahedron's six
edges.<br>

The ‘more knowledgeable other’, or MKO, shares knowledge with the student to bridge the gap between what is known and what is not known. Once the student has expanded his knowledge, the actual developmental level has been expanded and the ZPD has shifted. The ZPD is always changing as the student expands and gains knowledge, so scaffolded instruction must constantly be individualized to address the changing ZPD of each student.</i><br>

Cartesian dualism of mind and body is called into question as the primary way of existing in the world, and is ultimately rejected in favor of an intersubjective conception or dialectical and intentional concept of consciousness. The body is central to Merleau-Ponty's account of perception. In his view, the ability to reflect comes from a pre-reflective ground that serves as the foundation for reflecting on actions. ... The body stands between this fundamental distinction between subject and object, ambiguously existing as both. In Merleau-Ponty's discussion of human sexuality, he discusses psychoanalysis.

It is concerned with him solely as a being who desires to possess wealth, and who is capable of judging the comparative efficacy of means for obtaining that end.[4]

Later in the same work, Mill stated that he was proposing ""an arbitrary definition of man, as a being who inevitably does that by which he may obtain the greatest amount of necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries, with the smallest quantity of labour and physical self-denial with which they can be obtained.""

Dear Marcus,

Today’s essay is about dragons. In full disclosure, my personal experience with dragons is limited to puffing the magic one. That said, in reading Mimi’s essay on how the depiction of dragons diverge between Eastern and Western culture, I immediately thought of “Thou Shalt.” This was the peculiar name of Friedrich Nietzsche’s dragon in his philosophical tome, Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

The German philosopher often leveraged these fire-breathing creatures to symbolize the oppressive forces, societal norms and religious dogmas that individuals must overcome to achieve true self-realization.

One of Nietzsche’s most celebrated references to dragons appears in the concept of “The Three Metamorphoses,” where the nihilist describes three stages of spiritual transformation:
The Camel: Representing burden-bearing, where an individual unquestioningly carries the weight of societal and religious expectations.
The Lion: Reflecting the spirit of rebellion, where one fights against imposed values and seeks freedom.
The Child: Characterizing a state of radical creativity and new beginnings, embodying true self-overcoming.

During the Lion stage, Nietzsche describes a great dragon named ""Thou Shalt"" which represents the oppressive moral values imposed by tradition, religion, and authority. The dragon is covered in golden scales, each inscribed with a commandment of society—rules that dictate what is ""right"" and ""wrong.""

To move beyond this stage, the Lion must slay the dragon by declaring ""I Will!"", symbolizing the assertion of personal will and autonomy over imposed values.

Nietzsche’s use of the dragon metaphor is tied to his broader philosophy of self-overcoming. The dragon is a symbol of fear, control, and mental barriers, and only by defeating it can an individual achieve true freedom and self-actualization.

Today’s essayist, the Qigong teacher Mimi Kuo-Deemer, describes a very different depiction of the dragon as portrayed in Eastern mythology. Of course, the West and the East often clash in terms of how they interpret the natural world. In the West, we are taught to see nature as separate and hostile – something to be subdued and sublimated. The East understands humans as nature, mutually arising as part of it. 

Mimi has numerous wonderful courses on Commune, including Mindful Dragon Qigong, and I am pleased to feature her musing today. 

In love, include me,
Jeff
